# Visualization Publications (vispubs)

This repo contains the code and data for the [vispubs.com](https://vispubs.com) website. The goal of this project is to create a nice interface for finding relevant visualization publications across multiple venues.

## Licenses
In spirit this is an open-source academic project. If the data, analysis code, or front-end code are useful in some way, then use them. If you do use them (especially in an academic publication), then please cite this work. See the [about page](https://vispubs.com/about) for my preferred way of citing this work.

For the specific Licenses I use two different licenses. One for the data files, and one for the analysis/front-end code.
- Data Files (everything in public/data): CC-By 4.0, International. See LICENSE-DATA.md.
- Other Code (everything else): Apache 2.0. See LICENSE.
