EuroVis,2007,Relevance Driven Visualization of Financial Performance Measures,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/019-026,"Visual data analysis has received a lot of research interest in recent years, and a wide variety of new visualization techniques and applications have been developed to improve insight into the various application domains. In financial data analysis, however, analysts still primarily rely on a set of statistical performance parameters in combination with traditional line charts in order to evaluate assets and to make decisions, and information visualization is only very slowly entering this important domain. In this paper, we analyze some of the standard statistical measures for technical financial data analysis and demonstrate cases where they produce insufficient and misleading results that do not reflect the real performance of an asset. We propose a technique for visualizing financial time series data that eliminates these inadequacies, offering a complete view on the real performance of an asset. The technique is enhanced by relevance and weighting functions according to the users' preferences in order to emphasize specific regions of interest. Based on these principles we redefine some of the standard performance measures. We apply our technique on real world financial data sets and combine it with higher-level financial analysis techniques such as performance/risk analysis, dominance evaluation, and efficiency curves in order to show how traditional techniques from economics can be improved by modern visual data analysis techniques.",Hartmut Ziegler;Tilo Nietzschmann;Daniel A.

We address the problem of visualizing large time-related data sets which are difficult to visualize effectively with standard techniques given the limitations of current display devices. We propose a framework for intelligent time- and data-dependent visual aggregation of data along multiple resolution levels. This idea leads to effective visualization support for long time-series data providing both focus and context. The basic idea of the technique is that either data-dependent or application-dependent, display space is allocated in proportion to the degree of interest of data subintervals, thereby (a) guiding the user in perceiving important information, and (b) freeing required display space to visualize all the data. The automatic part of the framework can accommodate any time series analysis algorithm yielding a numeric degree of interest scale. We apply our techniques on real-world data sets, compare it with the standard visualization approach, and conclude the usefulness and scalability of the approach.",Ming C.

To represent temporal changes, polygons (instead of traditional lines) are rendered in parallel coordinates.

We present a novel visualization intended to reveal the uncertainty and variability inherent in statistically-derived lattice structures. Applications such as machine translation and automated speech recognition typically present users with a best-guess about the appropriate output, with apparent complete confidence.

EuroVis,2007,Manual Clustering Refinement using Interaction with Blobs,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/059-066,"The huge amount of different automatic clustering methods emphasizes one thing: there is no optimal clustering method for all possible cases. In certain application domains, like genomics and natural language processing, it is not even clear if any of the already known clustering methods suffice. In such cases, an automatic clustering method is often followed by manual refinement. The refined version may then be used as either an illustration, a reference, or even an input for a rule based or other machine learning algorithm as a new clustering method. In this paper, we describe a novel interaction technique to manual cluster refinement using the metaphor of soap bubbles, represented by special implicit surfaces (blobs). For instance, entities can simply be moved inside and outside of these blobs. A modified force-directed layout process automatically arranges entities equidistant on the screen. The modifications include a reduction to the expected amount of computation per iteration down to O(|V| log |V|+|E|) in order to achieve a high response time for use in an interactive system. We also spend a considerable amount of effort making the display of blobs fast enough for an interactive system.",Christian Heine 0002;Gerik Scheuermann,

Steerability allows exploration to begin immediately, rather than requiring a costly layout of the entire graph as an initial step. In a feature-based approach, the subgraph inside a metanode of the graph hierarchy is laid out with a well- chosen algorithm appropriate for its topological structure. Grouse preserves the input hierarchy, which provides meaningful information to the user when its metanodes correspond to features of interest. When a metanode in the hierarchy is opened, a limited number of metanodes are laid out again along the path between the opened node and the root. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grouse on datasets from IMDB, the Internet Movie Database, where nodes are actors and cliques represent movies. The combination of feature-based layout and limited relayout computation does not fragment features in the hierarchy and improves the number of levels in the hierarchy that can be seen at once over previous approaches.",Daniel Archambault;Tamara Munzner;David Auber,

A node-link diagram, however, is far better for the task of path finding because a path can be easily traced by following the corresponding links, provided that the links are not heavily crossed or tangled. We augment adjacency matrices with path visualization and associated interaction techniques to facilitate path finding.

Therefore, we combine selected aspects from storytelling as well as from interactive volume visualization to create a guided but at the same time interactive visualization presentation approach. To ease the observer's access to a presented visualization result we not only communicate the result itself, but also deliver its creational process in the form of an annotated visualization animation, which we call a visualization story. Additionally, we enable variable means of interactivity during story playback. The story observers may just watch the presentation passively, but they are also allowed to reinvestigate the visualization independently from story guidance, offering the ability to verify, confirm, or even disapprove the presented visualization message. For demonstration purposes, we developed a prototype application that provides tools to author, edit, and watch visualization stories.

EuroVis,2007,Dimensional Congruence for Interactive Visual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/099-106,"Many authors in the field of 3D human computer interaction have described the advantages of 3D user interfaces: Intuitive metaphors from daily life, immersive workspaces, virtual environments that closely resemble natural environments, and the usefulness of the third dimension as an additional visualization scale. Nevertheless, there are still few or no successful applications for complex information spaces that make use of it in a natural human-centered manner. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid user interface for knowledge workers to support document spaces and corresponding visualizations. We propose a combined 2D + 3D interface to support both visualization approaches and interaction metaphors to their maximum potential. Interaction is matched due to the principle of dimensional congruence and a thorough investigation of previous approaches and problems is given.

The TrustNeighborhoods technique uses the metaphor of a multi-layered city or fortress to intuitively represent trust as a simple geographic relation. The visualization uses a radial space-filling layout; there is a 2D mode for editing and configuration, as well as a 3D mode for exploration and overview. In addition, the 3D mode supports a simple animated ""fly-to"" command that is intended to show the user the context and trust of a particular document by zooming in on the document and its immediate neighborhood in the 3D city. The visualization is intended for integration into an existing desktop environment, connecting to the distributed file sharing mechanisms of the environment and non-obtrusively displaying a 3D orientation animation in the background for any file being accessed over the network. A formal user study shows that the technique supports significantly higher trust assignment accuracy than manual trust assignment at the cost of only a minor time investment.",Niklas Elmqvist;Philippas Tsigas,
EuroVis,2007,A Tri-Space Visualization Interface for Analyzing Time-Varying Multivariate Volume Data,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/115-122,"The dataset generated by a large-scale numerical simulation may include thousands of timesteps and hundreds of variables describing different aspects of the modeled physical phenomena. In order to analyze and understand such data, scientists need the capability to explore simultaneously in the temporal, spatial, and variable domains of the data. Such capability, however, is not generally provided by conventional visualization tools. This paper presents a new visualization interface addressing this problem. The interface consists of three components which abstracts the complexity of exploring in temporal, variable, and spatial domain, respectively. The first component displays time histograms of the data, helps the user identify timesteps of interest, and also helps specify time-varying features. The second component displays correlations between variables in parallel coordinates and enables the user to verify those correlations and possibly identity unanticipated ones. The third component allows the user to more closely explore and validate the data in spatial domain while rendering multiple variables into a single visualization in a user controllable fashion. Each of these three components is not only an interface but is also the visualization itself, thus enabling efficient screen-space usage. The three components are tightly linked to facilitate tri-space data exploration, which offers scientists new power to study their time-varying, multivariate volume data.",Hiroshi Akiba;Kwan-Liu Ma,

EuroVis,2007,Design of Multi-dimensional Transfer Functions Using Dimensional Reduction,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/131-138,"Direct volume rendering techniques allow visualization of volume data without extracting intermediate geometry. The mapping from voxel attributes to optical properties is performed by transfer functions which, consequently, play a crucial role in building informative images from the data. One-dimensional transfer functions, which are based only on a scalar value per voxel, often do not provide proper visualizations. On the other hand, multidimensional transfer functions can perform more sophisticated data classification, based on vectorial voxel signatures. The transfer function design is a non-trivial and unintuitive task, especially in the multi-dimensional case. In this paper we propose a multi-dimensional transfer function design technique that uses self-organizing maps to perform dimensional reduction. Our approach gives uniform treatment to volume data containing voxel signatures of arbitrary dimension, and allows the use of any type of voxel attribute as part of the voxel signatures.",Francisco de Moura Pinto;Carla M.

EuroVis,2007,Subdivision Volume Splatting,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/139-146,"Volumetric Subdivision (VS) is a powerful paradigm that enables volumetric sculpting and realistic volume deformations that give rise to the concept of ""virtual clay"". In VS, volumes are commonly represented as a space-filling set of deformed polyhedra, which can be further decomposed into a mesh of tetrahedra for rendering. Images can then be generated via tetrahedral projection or raycasting. A current shortcoming in VS-based operations is the need for a very high level of subdivision to represent fine detail in the mesh and to obtain a high-fidelity visualization. However, we have discovered that the subdivision process itself can be closely simulated with radial basis functions (RBFs), making it possible to replace the finer subdivision levels by a coarser aggregation of RBF kernels. This reduction to a simplified assembly of RBFs subsequently enables interactive rendering of volumetric subdivision shapes within a GPU-based volume splatting framework.",Kevin T.

EuroVis,2007,Flexible And Topologically Localized Segmentation,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/179-186,"One of the most common visualization tasks is the extraction of significant boundaries, often performed with isosurfaces or level set segmentation. Isosurface extraction is simple and can be guided by geometric and topological analysis, yet frequently does not extract the desired boundary. Level set segmentation is better at boundary extraction, but either leads to global segmentation without edges, [CV01], that scales unfavorably in 3D or requires an initial estimate of the boundary from which to locally solve segmentation with edges. We propose a hybrid system in which topological analysis is used for semi-automatic initialization of a level set segmentation, and geometric information bounded topologically is used to guide and accelerate an iterative segmentation algorithm that combines several state-of-the-art level set terms. We thus combine and improve both the flexible isosurface interface and level set segmentation without edges.",Gunnar Johansson;Ken Museth;Hamish A. Carr,

In this paper we present a parametric visualization technique which allows an analyst to examine spectral and spatially correlated patterns on the highest possible resolution. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to decompose the datacube into several discriminating components. We represent these extracted features as abstract geometric shapes and use three parameters to allow for data exploration. The first parameter thresholds the spectral contribution at which an extracted component is visualized. The level of detail the shapes is controlled by a second parameter and a third parameter determines at which density-level the extracted feature is represented. This new visualization technique enables an analyst to select the most relevant spectral correlations and investigate their specific spatial distribution. With this method, less noise is included in the visualization of extracted features and by introducing various levels of detail the full spectral resolution can be utilized.",Alexander Broersen;Robert van Liere;Ron M.

EuroVis,2007,Visualization Methods for Vortex Rings and Vortex Breakdown Bubbles,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/211-218,"Vortex breakdown bubbles are a subject which is of interest in many disciplines such as aeronautics, mixing, and combustion. Existing visualization methods are based on stream surfaces, direct volume rendering, tensor field visualization, and vector field topology. This paper presents a topological approach which is more closely oriented at the underlying theory of continuous dynamical systems. Algorithms are described for the detection of vortex rings and vortex breakdown bubbles, and for visualization of their characteristic properties such as the boundary, the chaotic dynamics, and possible islands of stability. Since some of these require very long streamlines, the effect of numerically introduced divergence has to be considered. From an existing subdivision scheme, a novel method for divergence conserving interpolation of cuboid cells is derived, and results are compared with those from standard trilinear interpolation. Also a comparison of results obtained with and without divergence cleaning is given.",Ronald Peikert;Filip Sadlo,
EuroVis,2007,Animation of Orthogonal Texture-Based Vector Field Visualization,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/219-226,"This paper introduces orthogonal vector field visualization on 2D manifolds: a representation by lines that are perpendicular to the input vector field. Line patterns are generated by line integral convolution (LIC). This visualization is combined with animation based on motion along the vector field. This decoupling of the line direction from the direction of animation allows us to choose the spatial frequencies along the direction of motion independently from the length scales along the LIC line patterns. Vision research indicates that local motion detectors are tuned to certain spatial frequencies of textures, and the above decoupling enables us to generate spatial frequencies optimized for motion perception. In addition, a filtering process is described to achieve a consistent and temporally coherent animation of the orthogonal vector field visualization. We present respective visualization algorithms for 2D planar vector fields and tangential vector fields on curved surfaces, and demonstrate that those algorithms lend themselves to efficient and interactive GPU implementations.",Sven Bachthaler;Daniel Weiskopf,
EuroVis,2007,Priority Streamlines: A context-based Visualization of Flow Fields,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/227-234,"Flow vector fields contain a wealth of information that needs to be visualized. As an extension of the well-known streamline technique, we have developed a context-based method for visualizing steady flow vector fields in two and three dimensions. We call our method ""Priority Streamlines"". In our approach, the density of the streamlines is controlled by a scalar function that can be user-defined, or be given by additional information (e.g., temperature, pressure, vorticity, velocity) considering the underlying flow vector field. In regions, which are interesting the streamlines are drawn with increased density, while less interesting regions are drawn sparsely. Since streamlines in the most important regions are drawn first, we can use thresholding to obtain a streamline representation highlighting essential features. Color-mapping and transparency can be used for visualizing other information hidden in the flow vector field.",Michael Schlemmer;Ingrid Hotz;Bernd Hamann;Florian Morr;Hans Hagen,
EuroVis,2007,Hardware-accelerated Stippling of Surfaces derived from Medical Volume Data,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/235-242,"We present a fast hardware-accelerated stippling method which does not require any preprocessing for placing points on surfaces. The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order to apply stippling textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our stippling technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the stippling process enables stippling for several complex objects simultaneously. We consider application scenarios in intervention planning (neck and liver surgery planning). In these scenarios, object recognition (shape perception) is supported by adding stippling to semi-transparently shaded objects which are displayed as context information.",Alexandra Baer;Christian Tietjen;Ragnar Bade;Bernhard Preim,

We consider two algorithms for progressive rendering from the morphological pyramid: one which projects detail coefficients level by level, and a second one, called streaming MIP, which resorts the detail coefficients of all levels simultaneously with respect to decreasing magnitude of a suitable error measure. The latter method outperforms the level-by-level method, both with respect to image quality with a fixed amount of detail data, and in terms of flexibility of controlling approximation error or computation time. We improve the streaming MIP algorithm, present a GPU implementation for both methods, and perform a comparison with existing CPU and GPU implementations.",Wladimir J. van der Laan;Andrei C.

EuroVis,2007,Functional Unit Maps for Data-Driven Visualization of High-Density EEG Coherence,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/259-266,"Synchronous electrical activity in different brain regions is generally assumed to imply functional relationships between these regions. A measure for this synchrony is electroencephalography (EEG) coherence, computed between pairs of signals as a function of frequency. Existing high-density EEG coherence visualizations are generally either hypothesis-driven, or data-driven graph visualizations which are cluttered. In this paper, a new method is presented for data-driven visualization of high-density EEG coherence, which strongly reduces clutter and is referred to as functional unit (FU) map. Starting from an initial graph, with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing significant coherences between electrode signals, we define an FU as a set of electrodes represented by a clique consisting of spatially connected vertices. In an FU map, the spatial relationship between electrodes is preserved, and all electrodes in one FU are assigned an identical gray value. Adjacent FUs are visualized with different gray values and FUs are connected by a line if the average coherence between FUs exceeds a threshold. Results obtained with our visualization are in accordance with known electrophysiological findings. FU maps can be used as a preprocessing step for conventional analysis.",Michael ten Caat;Natasha M.

Viewpoint selection techniques enhance the display of the currently selected structure. For animations in collaborative intervention planning and surgical education, the authoring process may be significantly enhanced if 'good' viewpoints for important objects as well as for the whole scene are chosen automatically. We describe a viewpoint selection technique guided by parameters like size of unoccluded surface, importance of occluding objects, preferred region and viewpoint stability. The influence of these parameters may be flexibly adjusted by weights. Parameter maps indicate the influence of the current parameter settings on the viewpoints. For selected applications, the weights may be predefined and reused for other cases.

A variety of techniques has been developed which provide smooth high-quality visualizations of vascular structures based on rather simple model assumptions. For diagnostic applications, these model assumptions and the resulting deviations from the actual vessel surface are not acceptable. We present a model-free approach which employs the binary result of a prior vessel segmentation as input. Instead of directly converting the segmentation result into a surface, we compute a point cloud which is adaptively refined at thin structures, where aliasing effects are particularly obvious and artifacts may occur. The point cloud is transformed into a surface representation by means of MPU Implicits, which provide a smooth piecewise quadratic approximation. Our method has been applied to a variety of datasets including pathologic cases. The generated visualizations are considerably more accurate than model-based approaches.

However, ray-tracing PSS is computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose an interactive ray-tracing algorithm for PSS implemented completely on commodity graphics hardware. We also exploit the advantages of PSS to propose a novel technique for extracting surfaces directly from volumetric data. This technique is based on the well known predictor-corrector principle from the numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations. Our technique provides good approximations to surfaces defined by a certain property in the volume, such as iso-surfaces or surfaces located at regions of high gradient magnitude. Also, local details of the surfaces could be manipulated by changing the local polynomial approximation and the smoothing parameters used.

This reduces the load on the CPU that would otherwise need to provide a suitable level-of-detail representation of the scene, while offering even higher quality in the resulting surfaces since every fragment is traced individually. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing it to the performance and output of conventional visualization tools in the application area of diffusion tensor imaging of human brain MR scans.

In our study, we evaluated three systems: RINGS (a node-link representation), Treemap (a containment representation), and Windows Explorer.

Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no isosurface extraction method exists that directly extracts surfaces from scattered volume data without 3D mesh generation or reconstruction over a structured grid. We propose a method based on spatial domain partitioning using a kd-tree and an indexing scheme for efficient neighbor search. Our approach consists of a geometry extraction and a rendering step. The geometry extraction step computes points on the isosurface by linearly interpolating between neighboring pairs of samples. The neighbor information is retrieved by partitioning the 3D domain into cells using a kd-tree. The cells are merely described by their index and bitwise index operations allow for a fast determination of potential neighbors. We use an angle criterion to select appropriate neighbors from the small set of candidates. The output of the geometry step is a point cloud representation of the isosurface. The final rendering step uses point-based rendering techniques to visualize the point cloud. 
 
Our direct isosurface extraction algorithm for scattered volume data produces results of quality close to the results from standard isosurface extraction algorithms for gridded volume data (like marching cubes). In comparison to 3D mesh generation algorithms (like Delaunay tetrahedrization), our algorithm is about one order of magnitude faster for the examples used in this paper.",Paul Rosenthal;Lars Linsen,

They acquire the knowledge of the access history and patterns dynamically, and adapt their prefetching strategies accordingly. We have compared the algorithms with a demand-based algorithm, as well as a more domain-specific out-of-core algorithm. We carried out our evaluation in conjunction with an example application where rendering multiple point sets in a volume scene graph put a great strain on the rendering algorithm in terms of memory management. Our results have shown that the knowledge-based approach offers a better cache-hit to disk-access trade-off.

Our goal was to come up with a method that falls into the first category, yet reveals structural information. We have developed a dense flow visualization method that shows the overall flow behavior while accentuating structural information without performing a topological analysis. Our method is based on a geometry-based flow integration step and a texture-based visual exploration step. The flow integration step generates a density field, which is written into a texture. The density field is generated by tracing particles under the influence of the underlying vector field. When using a quasi-random seeding strategy for initialization, the resulting density is high in attracting regions and low in repelling regions. Density is measured by the number of particles per region accumulated over time. We generate one density field using forward and one using backward propagation. The density fields are explored using texture-based rendering techniques. We generate the two output images separately and blend the results, which allows us to distinguish between inflow and outflow regions. We obtained dense flow visualizations that display the overall flow behavior, emphasize critical and separating regions, and indicate flow direction in the neighborhood of these regions.

EuroVis,2006,A Spectral Visualization System for Analyzing Financial Time Series Data,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis06/195-202,"Visual data analysis of time related data sets has attracted much research interest recently, and a number of sophisticated visualization methods have been proposed in the past. In financial analysis, however, the most important and most common visualization techniques for time series data is the traditional line- or bar chart. Although these are intuitive and make it easy to spot the effect of key events on a asset's price, and its return over a given period of time, price charts do not allow the easy perception of relative movements in terms of growth rates, which is the key feature of any price-related time series. 
 
This paper presents a novel Growth Matrix visualization technique for analyzing assets. It extends the ability of existing chart techniques by not only visualizing asset return rates over fixed time frames, but over the full spectrum of all subintervals present in a given time frame, in a single view. At the same time, the technique allows a comparison of subinterval return rates among groups of even a few hundreds of assets. This provides a powerful way for analyzing financial data, since it allows the identification of strong and weak periods of assets as compared to global market characteristics, and thus allows a more encompassing visual classification into ""good"" and ""poor"" performers than existing chart techniques. We illustrate the technique by real-world examples showing the abilities of the new approach, and its high relevance for financial analysis tasks.",Daniel A.

PointCloudXplore uses the established visualization techniques of multiple views, brushing, and linking to support the analysis of high-dimensional datasets that describe many genes' expression. Each of the views in PointCloud- Xplore shows a different gene expression data property. Brushing is used to select and emphasize data associated with defined subsets of embryo cells within a view. Linking is used to show in additional views the expression data for a group of cells that have first been highlighted as a brush in a single view, allowing further data subset properties to be determined. In PointCloudXplore, physical views of the data are linked to parallel coordinates. Physical views show the spatial relationships between different genes' expression patterns within the embryo. Parallel coordinates, on the other hand, show only some features of each gene's expression, but allow simultaneous analysis of data for many more genes than would be possible in a physical view. We have developed several extensions to standard parallel coordinates to facilitate brushing the visualization of 3D gene expression data.",Oliver Rübel;Gunther H. Weber;Soile V. E.

EuroVis,2006,D2VR: High-Quality Volume Rendering of Projection-based Volumetric Data,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis06/211-218,"Volume rendering techniques are conventionally classified as either direct or indirect methods. Indirect methods require to transform the initial volumetric model into an intermediate geometrical model in order to efficiently visualize it. In contrast, direct volume rendering (DVR) methods can directly process the volumetric data. Modern CT scanners usually provide data as a set of samples on a rectilinear grid, which is computed from the measured projections by discrete tomographic reconstruction. Therefore the rectilinear grid can already be considered as an intermediate volume representation. In this paper we introduce direct direct volume rendering (D2VR). D2VR does not require a rectilinear grid, since it is based on an immediate processing of the measured projections. Arbitrary samples for ray casting are reconstructed from the projections by using the Filtered Back-Projection algorithm. Our method removes a lossy resampling step from the classical volume rendering pipeline. It provides much higher accuracy than traditional grid-based resampling techniques do. Furthermore we also present a novel high-quality gradient estimation scheme, which is also based on the Filtered Back-Projection algorithm.",Peter Rautek;Balázs Csébfalvi;Sören Grimm;Stefan Bruckner;M.

Unfortunately, the computational expense of performing the resampling needed to implement volume deformation has precluded its use in interactive applications. In this paper, we show how non-linear deformations can be integrated into interactive volume visualization allowing for dynamic deformations to be used along with interactive viewing, exploration, and manipulation tools. We describe how hardware assisted volume rendering can be adapted to resample volume deformations, leveraging programmable shaders to compute deformations and the local coordinate transformations required for shading effects. We describe how volume interaction techniques, such as ray picking and plane slicing, can be used in concert with our deformation methods. Our methods extend to simultaneous display of multiple volumes enabling comparisons. We demonstrate dynamic volume deformation at interactive rates on commodity hardware for interactive deformation control, animated deformations, and volume widgets.",Tom Brunet;K.

However, the unstructured nature of these data sets lead to rather slow implementations for ray tracing. The approaches discussed in this paper are fast and scalable towards realtime ray tracing applications. 
 
We evaluate new algorithms for rendering tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. In each algorithm, the first cell along a ray is found using common realtime ray tracing techniques. For traversing subsequent cells within the volume, Plucker coordinates as well as ray-bilinear patch intersection tests are used. Since the volume is rendered directly, all algorithms are applicable for isosurface rendering, maximum-intensity projection, and emissionabsorption models.",Gerd Marmitt;Philipp Slusallek,

Similarly to other approaches we generate clusters in the transfer function domain. We created a real-time interaction with a hierarchy of clusters. This interaction effectively substitutes cumbersome settings of clustering thresholds. Our framework is also able to easily combine different clustering criteria. 
 
We have developed two similarity measures for clustering of material boundaries. One is based on the similarity of the boundaries in the transfer function domain and the other on their spatial relation. We use the LH space as the transfer function domain. This space facilitates the clustering of material boundaries. We demonstrate our approach on several examples.",Petr Sereda;Anna Vilanova;Frans A. Gerritsen,

This permits extreme changes in resolution across block boundaries and removes the interblock dependency for the LOD creation process. In addition the full data reduction from the LOD selection can be maintained throughout the rendering pipeline.

Our geometry coder is truly lossless and also does not need any connectivity information.

The input of the system is a CT scan of the coral, and the output consists of statistical distributions of various morphological properties. The approach is to first extract a skeleton from the CT scan, and then to perform measurements on the skeleton graph.

We present an application that allows process operators to freely choose how absolute temperatures and time varying changes of thermographic scans should be mapped to colors and/or 3D shapes. Of the possible combinations, we selected two different forms of 3D visualizations and an existing conventional 2D map visualization. We then evaluated these visualization forms with regard to their effectiveness in experimental field studies. The field tests were carried out to measure the operators' performance in early detection of insulation damages on lime kilns. The results we obtained from the study show that the two new forms of 3D visualization lead to a reduction of the detection times by about two-thirds and one-third, respectively, when compared to the conventional 2D map representation. Since lime kiln monitoring is based on the rather generic method of continuous thermographic imaging, we suggest that these results also hold for the control and surveillance of other processes.",Stefan Seipel;Ann-Kristin Forsberg;Daniel Wesslén,

This paper presents a system for real-time perspective direct volume and isosurface rendering, which allows to simultaneously visualize both the interesting tissue and everything that is behind. Large volume data can be viewed seamlessly from inside or outside the volume without any pre-computation or segmentation. Our system uses a novel ray-casting pipeline for GPUs that has been optimized for the requirements of virtual endoscopy and also allows easy incorporation of auxiliary geometry, e.g., for displaying parts of the endoscopic device, pointers, or grid lines for orientation purposes.

In this paper, we describe a semi-automatic processing pipeline how data from 3D photogrammetry is combined and used to generate a visual surface representation of accident victims. In that course, a number of steps are performed to provide a high-quality interactive, point-based visualization of the acquired data, which can be used in a more routine way than previous forensic surface methods.",Alexander Ehlert;Zein Salah;Dirk Bartz,
EuroVis,2006,3D Soft Segmentation and Visualization of Medical Data Based on Nonlinear Diffusion and Distance Functions,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis06/331-338,"Visualization of medical 3D data is a complex problem, since the raw data is often unsuitable for standard techniques like Direct Volume Rendering. Some kind of pre-treatment is necessary, usually segmentation of the structures of interest, which in turn is a difficult task. Most segmentation techniques yield a model without indicating any uncertainty. Visualization then can be misleading, especially if the original data is of poor contrast. 
 
We address this dilemma proposing a geometric approach based on distance on image manifolds and an alternative approach based on nonlinear diffusion. An effective algorithm solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations allows for computing a distance function for 2D and 3D manifolds at interactive rates. An efficient implementation of a semi-implicit operator splitting scheme accomplishes interactivity for the diffusion-based strategy. We establish a model which incorporates local information about its reliability and can be visualized with standard techniques.

This approach results in fast read and write access to physical memory, independent of GPU architecture. Slice-based direct volume rendering is used for the final display. A real-time computation of gradients is employed to achieve volume illumination. Perception-guided volume shading methods are included, such as halos, cool/warm shading, or color-based depth cueing.

However, traditional methods leave much room for improvement. 
 
In this article we investigate the visualization of large vector fields, departing from accustomed processing algorithms by casting vector field simplification as a variational partitioning problem. Adopting an iterative strategy, we introduce the notion of vector ""proxies"" to minimize the distortion error of our simplification by clustering the dataset into multiple best-fitting characteristic regions. This error driven approach can be performed with respect to various similarity metrics, offering a convenient set of tools to design clear and succinct representations of high dimensional datasets.

The context-preserving volume rendering model uses a function of shading intensity, gradient magnitude, distance to the eye point, and previously accumulated opacity to selectively reduce the opacity in less important data regions.

We demonstrate that deferred filtering overcomes this problem by using a two-pass decompression and rendering strategy. With this method interpolation and gradient calculations are very efficient, allowing high quality rendering directly from packed or compressed volume data.

Training with simulator is generally low in cost and more efficient than traditional methods that involve supervised learning on actual patients. Incorporating genuine patient data in the simulation can significantly improve the efficacy of training and skills assessment. In this paper, a photo-realistic simulation architecture is described that utilises patient-specific models for training in minimally invasive surgery. The datasets are constructed by combining computer tomographic images with bronchoscopy video of the same patient so that the three dimensional structures and visual appearance are accurately matched. Using simulators enriched by a library of datasets with sufficient patient variability, trainees can experience a wide range of realistic scenarios, including rare pathologies, with correct visual information. In this paper, the matching of CT and video data is accomplished by using a newly developed 2D/3D registration method that exploits a shape from shading similarity measure. Additionally, a method has been devised to allow shading parameter estimation by modelling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the visible surfaces. The derived BRDF is then used to predict the expected shading intensity such that a texture map independent of lighting conditions can be extracted. Thus new views can be generated that were not captured in the original bronchoscopy video, thus allowing free navigation of the acquired 3D model with enhanced photo-realism.",Adrian James Chung;Fani Deligianni;Pallav L.

Principal component analysis separates these peaks in different uncorrelated components and can simultaneously identify spatial patterns.

This subset, called a seed-set, has the property that every iso-surface must intersect with it, and it could be built at the preprocessing time. When an iso-value is given at the run time, iso-contouring algorithm starts from the intersected cells in the seed-set, and gradually propagates to form the whole iso-surface. As smaller seed-sets offer less cell searching time, most existing iso-contouring algorithms concentrates on how to identify an optimal seed-set. In this paper, we propose a new and linear-time approach for seed-set construction. This presented algorithm could reduce the size of the generated seed-sets by up to one or two orders of magnitude, compared with other previously proposed fast (linear time) algorithms.",Chiang-Han Hung;Chuan-Kai Yang,

We define a parallelization scheme for level of detail algorithms in cluster-based environments. The scheme relies on modern PC clusters capabilities to address the scalability issue of level of detail algorithms. To achieve this, we propose an eficient tile-based data partitioning method that allows both reducing load imbalance and solving the well-known border problem. At runtime level of detail computations are performed in parallel on cluster nodes. A hierarchical view frustum culling combined to a compression mechanism harnessing the frame-to-frame coherence are used to drastically reduce the inter-tasks communication overhead.

To this purpose, we subtract the potential flow that is induced by the boundary of the sub-domain from the original flow. Since the potential flow is free of both divergence and rotation, the localized flow field retains the original features. In contrast to similar approaches, by making explicit use of the boundary flow of the subregion, we manage to isolate the region-specific flow that contains exactly the local contribution of the considered subdomain to the global flow. In the remainder of the paper, we describe an implementation on unstructured grids in both two and three dimensions.

These PIV-images are quite a challenge as the noise due to the measurement method and the inherent turbulence of the flow can not be distinguished. Furthermore, features are often hidden by a mean flow, which is influenced by vortices and therefore not easy to determine. The authors present some image processing methods adapted to these vector fields for the computation of position, size, and direction of the vortices in this data.

In these simulations, an entire distribution of nanoparticles is computed at every point across a two-dimensional slice of the data space, for every time step. Previous visualization methods have relied on multiple separate images to convey summary statistics about the datasets, including mean diameter and standard deviation of particle sizes. We introduce new methods based on texture which aim to enable the integrated understanding of the entire distribution of values at each point across the domain in terms of both summary statistics at each point and particle counts for various sizes of particles. Pointillism is used to represent the data at each point across the data range as a high-resolution texture.

Our approach allows domain experts to visualize the results of molecular dynamics simulations with a higher number of particles than before and furthermore offers much better visual quality. We achieve this by transferring only visualization parameters to the GPU and by generating implicit surfaces directly in the fragment program. As a result, we can render up to 500.000 glyphs with about 10 fps displaying all the simulation results as geometrical properties that resemble the classical abstract representation used in this research area. Thus we enable researchers to visually assess the results of simulations of greater scale than before.

Output optimal extraction algorithms perform an amount of work dominated by the size of the (output) isosurface rather than the size of the (input) data set. While several optimal methods have been proposed to accelerate isosurface extraction, these algorithms are relatively complicated to implement or require quantized values as input. Our method is based on a straightforward array data structure that only requires an auxiliary sorting routine for construction.

Using a regular background texture to visualize the refractive properties of the volumetric object, we also describe an efficient scheme to achieve the effects of supersampling without incurring any extra raycasting overhead.

However, the problems start as soon as mail volumes go beyond the scope of human information processing capabilities. Firstly, time does not allow for leaving certain messages unanswered for a long time, and in certain cases, for reading all messages. Secondly, the dilemma of electronic filters leaves a choice of too many junk mails getting through versus a risk of solicited mails being dumped. 
 
In this paper we present a new interactive visual data mining approach for analyzing individual e-mail communication. It combines classical visual analytics (help to identify pattern such as peaks and trends over time) with geo-spatial map distortions (help to understand the routes of e-mails). Experiments show that our visual e-mail explorer produces useful and interesting visualizations of large collections of e-mail and is practical for exploring temporal and geo-spatial patterns hidden in the e-mail data.",Daniel A.

The complexity of such mapping often makes it difficult for a user to manually explore and manipulate the design parameter space to produce the desired output. Computer assistance is therefore useful in setting the mapping parameter values to generate desired outputs. Existing systems rely on exploring the entire input parameter space, which can be time and resource-intensive, particularly if the number of input parameters is large. We introduce a new approach to handling a large number of mapping parameters more efficiently. The basis for our approach is the identification of a small and effective set of highlevel parameters that can be associated directly with the characteristics of the outputs. Users will have a better understanding of this small set of high-level parameters and can easily modify their values interactively to produce the desired outputs.

However, its deployment in everyday clinical use has so far been limited. Two major challenges are that the current methods for Transfer Function (TF) construction are too complex and that the tissue separation abilities of the TF need to be extended. In this paper we propose the use of histogram analysis in local neighborhoods to address both these conflicting problems. To reduce TF construction difficulty, we introduce Partial Range Histograms in an automatic tissue detection scheme, which in connection with Adaptive Trapezoids enable efficient TF design. To separate tissues with overlapping intensity ranges, we propose a fuzzy classification based on local histograms as a second TF dimension.

Using this information we can easily classify the histogram and derive a transfer function by assigning unique colors to each class of the histogram.

Instead, tessellation happens 'justin- time' given a certain camera position, image size and interaction demand. Thus, our approach is based on multiresolution meshes and on new extensions of graphics hardware. The paper shows how to reduce geometric data by using subdivision surfaces for ribbon structures and molecular surfaces and by using billboards instead of spheres consisting of triangles. It also shows how to use fragment shaders to create a three dimensional appearance and realistic sphere intersections.

The lighting for pre-integrated rendering is therefore subject to the same sampling artifacts as in standard volume rendering. We propose methods to speed up lookup table generation and minimize lighting artifacts. The incremental subrange integration method we describe allows interactive lookup table generation in O(n2) time without the need for approximation or hardware assistance.

Since the radial basis functions (RBFs) we use for encoding can provide a compact representation of volumetric scalar fields, the large grid/mesh traditionally needed for rendering is no longer required and ceases to be a data transfer and computational bottleneck during rendering. Our new approach will interactively render RBF encoded data obtained from arbitrary volume data sets, including both structured volume models and unstructured scattered volume models.

We use a treemap to visualize the basic structure of the document and exploit color coding to show the distribution of query terms on various levels of the hierarchy. Furthermore, we include filtering techniques to concentrate on those parts of the structure that actually contain the requested information, and, finally provide interactive tools to give access to detailed information whenever the user wishes.",Stefan Schlechtweg;Petra Schulze-Wollgast;Heidrun Schumann,
EuroVis,2004,Visual Component Analysis,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/129-136,"We propose to integrate information visualization techniques with factor analysis. Specifically, a principal direction derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data is displayed together with the data in a scatterplot matrix. The direction can be adjusted to coincide with visual trends in the data. Projecting the data onto the orthogonal subspace allows determining the next direction. The set of directions identified in this way forms an orthogonal space, which represents most of the variation in the data. We call this process visual component analysis (VCA). Furthermore, it is quite simple to integrate VCA with clustering. The user fits poly-lines to the displayed data, and the poly-lines implicitly define clusters. Per-cluster projection leads to the definition of per-cluster components.",Wolfgang Müller 0004;Marc Alexa,
EuroVis,2004,Interaction Spaces in Data and Information Visualization,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/137-146,"User interaction plays an integral part in the effective visualization of data and information. Typical interaction operations include navigation, selection, and distortion. A problem that can occur when these operations are speci£ed using direct manipulation is determining which object or space is the focus of the interaction. In some operations the user wants to indicate a region of an image, while in others the focus might be the data being projected or the surface upon which the projection is occurring. In this paper we attempt to identify a complete list of spaces within which interactive operations can occur in data and information visualization. These interaction spaces help disambiguate the focus of interactive operations, and their study can potentially reveal new and powerful methods for supporting the visual exploration process. We de£ne the distinctions between the spaces and provide examples of interactions within each space.",Matthew O. Ward;Jing Yang 0001,
EuroVis,2004,Superquadric tensor glyphs,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/147-154,"Tensor field visualization is a challenging task due in part to the multi-variate nature of individual tensor samples. Glyphs convey tensor variables by mapping the tensor eigenvectors and eigenvalues to the orientation and shape of a geometric primitive, such as a cuboid or ellipsoid. Though widespread, cuboids and ellipsoids have problems of asymmetry and visual ambiguity. Cuboids can display misleading orientation for tensors with underlying rotational symmetry. Ellipsoids differing in shape can be confused, from certain viewpoints, because of similarities in profile and shading. This paper addresses the problems of asymmetry and ambiguity with a new tunable continuum of glyphs based on superquadric surfaces. Superquadric tensor glyphs enjoy the necessary symmetry properties of ellipsoids, while also imitating cuboids and cylinders to better convey shape and orientation, where appropriate. The new glyphs are demonstrated on fields of diffusion tensors from the human brain.",Gordon L. Kindlmann,

Usually the user defines an area from where the fibers are generated. In this way, the user can miss part of the information, if the area is not correctly defined.

EuroVis,2004,Boundary Switch Connectors for Topological Visualization of Complex 3D Vector Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/183-192,"One of the reasons that topological methods have a limited popularity for the visualization of complex 3D flow fields is the fact that their topological structures contain a number of separating stream surfaces. Since these stream surfaces tend to hide each other as well as other topological features, for complex 3D topologies the visualizations become cluttered and hardly interpretable. One solution of this problem is the recently introduced concept of saddle connectors which treats separation surfaces emanating from critical points. In this paper we extend this concept to separation surfaces starting from boundary switch curves. This way we obtain a number of particular stream lines called boundary switch connectors. They connect either two boundary switch curves or a boundary switch curve with a saddle. We discuss properties and computational issues of boundary switch connectors and apply them to topologically complex flow data.",Tino Weinkauf;Holger Theisel;Hans-Christian Hege;Hans-Peter Seidel,

In this work, a field auralization technique is introduced, which objective is at the sound synthesis from field information represented as 3D time-varying volume data. Our technique takes a hybrid approach between parameter mapping and direct simulation. During preprocessing, acoustic strengths are computed at each vertex at each time step of volume data. During interaction, users navigate within the volume space and audio frames are computed by integrating the radiations from the sources.

The advantages of this approach is that a curved element can be directly visualized. Conventionally, higher-order elements are tessellated with several linear elements so that standard visualization techniques can be applied to the linear elements. Our method primarily focuses on how to find an approximation to the intersection between a ray and a curved-quadratic element. Once this approximation is found, conventional accumulation and color mapping techniques can be applied to the approximation to produce a volumetric visualization of the element. A cutting plane implementation is also shown that leverages the ray casting technique.",David F. Wiley;Henry R. Childs;Bernd Hamann;Kenneth I. Joy,
EuroVis,2004,Interactive High Quality Trimmed NURBS Visualization Using Appearance Preserving Tessellation,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/211-220,"Trimmed NURBS models are the standard representation used in CAD/CAM systems and accurate visualization of large trimmed NURBS models at interactive frame rates is of great interest for industry. To visualize the quality of a surface several techniques like isophotes, reflection lines, etc. are used. Most existing approaches transform the NURBS surfaces into a fine polygonal representation and build static levels of detail from this representation. This polygonal approximation together with its normals are adjusted in a semi-automatic procedure to achieve the desired visual fidelity during visualization. Since this approach allows only for a fixed maximum accuracy and does not support deformable models, another more recent approach is to keep the NURBS representation and generate view-dependent LODs on the fly up to the currently required preciseness.
 However, so far this approach took only into account the geometric error of an approximation and thus neglected the various illumination artifacts introduced by the chosen (possibly view-dependent) triangulation. Although this problem can be solved by using normal maps, the resolution of the normal maps again limits the accuracy. Furthermore, the normal map generation requires a preprocessing step which prevents the support of deformable NURBS models. In this paper we present a novel automatic tessellation algorithm that considers the illumination artifacts and is well suited both for the generation of static and dynamic LOD schemes with guaranteed visual fidelity. Our new method is also capable of high quality visualization of further attributes like curvature, temperature, etc. on surfaces with little or no modification.",Michael Guthe;Ákos Balázs;Reinhard Klein,

It is important to present data in a way that allows the user a high level understanding of the overall organization and structure without losing the ability to study low level detail as needed. Although hierarchically clustered data is already organized, many current means of presenting such data give the user little more than an overview of the organization. It would be useful to see more information about the data even at a high level and to examine specific clusters as needed. We want to understand the relationships of the clusters in terms of the underlying data, and to understand the extent and variability of the data without requiring examination of each data item. To meet these goals, we present an aesthetically appealing visualization based on botanical trees which preserves the natural order of hierarchically organized data. Hierarchical data is rendered as a simple branched tree. The tree gives an overview of the relationships among various clusters and is supplemented with two glyphs which allow the user to focus in on specific clusters of the data at different levels of detail. At a medium level of focus, a cluster glyph based on a radial, space filling approach shows the subtree rooted at a specified cluster. At a low level of detail, the branch glyph allows the viewer to see not only aggregate information about the cluster but the extent and variability of the component clusters.",Eleanor Boyle Chlan;Penny Rheingans,

The raw, highdimensional data is mapped into an abstract 3D distance space using the FastMap algorithm, which helps, together with other linear preprocessing steps, to make changes to the resulting 3D representation within a few seconds. Thus exploration of such datasets is a less tedious task compared to other techniques. We use volumes with four components to enable the user to brush an attribute selection onto the volume for inspection. We exploit multiple transfer functions for displaying these attributes and also to filter one attribute with values of another. An advantage of this volume sampling approach is that the rendering performance is independent of the dataset size. The drawback of limited resolution can be overcome by providing a linked detail view for a freely selectable portion of space. Examples of the inspection and filtering possibilities using a silvicultural dataset illustrate the strengths of our approach.",Guido Reina;Thomas Ertl,

This paper presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented programs using landscape-like distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The familiar landscape methaphor facilitates intuitive navigation and comprehension.

We present a three pass algorithm, which makes efficient use of this feature. Our geo-scientific sub-surface data sets consist typically of a set of high resolution height fields, polygonal objects, and volume slices and lenses. For each height field, we compute a low and high resolution version in a pre-process and divide both into sets of corresponding tiles. For each tile and for the polygonal objects, the first rendering pass computes a z-buffer image using the low resolution tiles, the polygonal objects and the non-transparent volume objects. During the second pass, we render the same objects against the z-buffer of the first pass while submitting an occlusion query with each object. The third pass reads this occlusion information back from the graphics hardware and renders only those high resolution objects, for which the corresponding low resolution objects were not completely occluded. To avoid fill rate bottle necks, the first two passes may be rendered to a low resolution window. Our implementation shows frame rate improvements for all test cases while introducing only a small overhead and no or hardly noticeable errors. Our non-conservative approach does not require front to back sorting and it works for dynamic scenes.",John Plate;Anselm Grundhöfer;Benjamin Schmidt;Bernd Fröhlich 0001,

Multiblock data sets are commonplace in computational mechanics applications. Relatively little research has been performed on contouring multiblock data sets, particularly when the grids overlap one another. Our algorithm proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we determine a continuous interpolant using a set of locally defined radial basis functions (RBFs) in conjunction with a partition of unity method to blend smoothly between these functions. In the second step, we extract isosurface geometry by sampling points on Marching Cubes triangles and projecting these point samples onto the isosurface defined by our interpolant. A surface splatting algorithm is employed for visualizing the resulting point set representing the isosurface. Because of our method's generality, it inherently solves the ""crack problem"" in isosurface generation. Results using a set of synthetic data sets and a discussion of practical considerations are presented. The importance of our method is that it can be applied to arbitrary grid data regardless of mesh layout or orientation.",Christopher S. Co;Serban D. Porumbescu;Kenneth I. Joy,

It allows scientists to focus on regions of interest and track their evolution and interaction over time. To allow the user to freely explore the data set, features must be tracked in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present an efficient time-varying isosurface tracking algorithm. Unlike the previous algorithms which compute the corresponding isosurface components in the adjacent time steps by performing expensive computation at run time, our algorithm can rapidly identify corresponding isosurfaces by performing simple table lookup operations. This table, called the correspondence lookup table, can be computed at a preprocessing stage. The idea behind our approach is that the correspondence relationship can only change at critical isovalues in R3 or R4 and remains unchanged between adjacent pairs of critical isovalues. With our algorithm, isosurfaces can be tracked in an efficient manner with minimal overhead.",Guangfeng Ji;Han-Wei Shen,
EuroVis,2004,Isosurface Computation Made Simple,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/293-300,"This paper presents a simple approach for rendering isosurfaces of a scalar field. Using the vertex programming capability of commodity graphics cards, we transfer the cost of computing an isosurface from the Central Processing Unit (CPU), running the main application, to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), rendering the images. We consider a tetrahedral decomposition of the domain and draw one quadrangle (quad) primitive per tetrahedron. A vertex program transforms the quad into the piece of isosurface within the tetrahedron (see Figure 2). In this way, the main application is only devoted to streaming the vertices of the tetrahedra from main memory to the graphics card. For adaptively refined rectilinear grids, the optimization of this streaming process leads to the definition of a new 3D space-filling curve, which generalizes the 2D Sierpinski curve used for efficient rendering of triangulated terrains. We maintain the simplicity of the scheme when constructing view-dependent adaptive refinements of the domain mesh. In particular, we guarantee the absence of T-junctions by satisfying local bounds in our nested error basis. The expensive stage of fixing cracks in the mesh is completely avoided. We discuss practical tradeoffs in the distribution of the workload between the application and the graphics hardware. With current GPU's it is convenient to perform certain computations on the main CPU. Beyond the performance considerations that will change with the new generations of GPU's this approach has the major advantage of avoiding completely the storage in memory of the isosurface vertices and triangles.",Valerio Pascucci,

The speedup is gained by exploiting inter-pixel coherency and by finding a near-optimal compromise between reduction of ray-tracking distances and limitation of the administrational cost associated with this reduction.

The error between two time steps is defined as the distance between the data of these time steps. Error tables are used to look up the error between different time steps of a time-varying dataset, especially when run time error computation is expensive. However, even the generation of error tables itself can be expensive. For n time steps, the exact error look-up table (which stores the error values for all pairs of time steps in a matrix) has a memory complexity and pre-processing time complexity of O(n2), and O(1) for error retrieval.Our approximate error look-up table approach uses trees, where the leaf nodes represent original time steps, and interior nodes contain an average (or best-representative) of the children nodes. The error computed on an edge of a tree describes the distance between the two nodes on that edge. Evaluating the error between two different time steps requires traversing a path between the two leaf nodes, and accumulating the errors on the traversed edges. For n time steps, this scheme has a memory complexity and pre-processing time complexity of O(n log(n)), a significant improvement over the exact scheme; the error retrieval complexity is O(log(n)). As we do not need to calculate all possible n2 error terms, our approach is a fast way to generate the approximation.",Christof Nuber;Eric LaMar;Valerio Pascucci;Bernd Hamann;Kenneth I. Joy,

In this paper we propose a new approach to handling high dimensional data, named Visual Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (VHDR), that addresses these drawbacks. VHDR not only generates lower dimensional spaces that are meaningful to users, but also allows user interactions in most steps of the process. In VHDR, dimensions are grouped into a hierarchy, and lower dimensional spaces are constructed using clusters of the hierarchy. We have implemented the VHDR approach into XmdvTool, and extended several traditional multidimensional visualization methods to convey dimension cluster characteristics when visualizing the data set in lower dimensional spaces. Our case study of applying VHDR to a real data set supports our belief that this approach is effective in supporting the exploration of high dimensional data sets.",Jing Yang 0001;Matthew O.

From a path we get exactly one seed per component, which reduces storage and simplifies isosurface extraction. Moreover, the correspondence allows us to extend the contour spectrum of Bajaj et al. to an interface that we call flexible isosurfaces, in which individual contours with different isovalues can be displayed, manipulated and annotated. The largest contour segmentation, in which separate surfaces are generated for each local maximum of the field, is a special case of the flexible isosurface.",Hamish A. Carr;Jack Snoeyink,

The simplification continues until we detect an edge whose collapse would change the topology of the surface. It happens when three edges of the surface form a triangle that does not belong to the surface. The three edges define what we call a seed curve and are used to initialize the search of a constriction. Secondly, the constriction is progressively constructed by incrementally refining the simplified surface until the initial surface is retrieved. At each step of this refinement process, the constriction is updated. Some experimental results are provided.",Franck Hétroy;Dominique Attali,

The vertices are confined to the edges of the grid that penetrate this separating surface and the precise positions are computed so as to optimize a certain energy functional applied to the surface.

EuroVis,2003,Detecting Critical Regions in Scalar Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym03/085-094,"Trivariate data is commonly visualized using isosurfaces or direct volume rendering. When exploring scalar fields by isosurface extraction it is often difficult to choose isovalues that convey ""useful"" information. The significance of visualizations using direct volume rendering depends on the choice of good transfer functions. Understanding and using isosurface topology can help in identifying ""relevant"" isovalues for visualization via isosurfaces and can be used to automatically generate transfer functions.Critical isovalues indicate changes in topology of an isosurface: the creation of new surface components, merging of surface components or the formation of holes in a surface component. Interesting isosurface behavior is likely to occur at and around critical isovalues. Current approaches to detect critical isovalues are usually limited to isolated critical points. Data sets often contain regions of constant value (i.e., mesh edges, mesh faces, or entire mesh cells). We present a method that detects critical points, critical regions and corresponding critical isovalues for a scalar field defined by piecewise trilinear interpolation over a uniform rectilinear grid. We describe how to use the resulting list of critical regions/points and associated values to examine trivariate data.",Gunther H. Weber;Gerik Scheuermann;Bernd Hamann,

We utilize several different evaluation methods, both analytical and experimental. The former includes the order of decay of the global error, the local spatial error, and the behavior of the filters in the frequency domain. In the experimental part, visualizations of both synthetic and medical data are produced and studied. We show that the HDAFs exhibit superior behavior if the volumetric data are distorted by high frequency noise, and perform well under noise free conditions.

Shell rendering consists of efficient data-structures and methods to manipulate and render structures with non-precise boundaries in volume data. We have updated these algorithms by creating an implementation that makes effective use of ubiquitously available commercial graphics hardware. More significantly, we have extended the algorithm to make use of elliptical Gaussian splats instead of straight-forward voxel projection. This dramatically increases the quality of the renderings, especially with anisotropically sampled volumes. The use of the graphics hardware alleviates the performance penalty of using splats.",Charl P. Botha;Frits H. Post,

Extracting regions using binary masks generated by contemporary segmentation approaches typically introduces aliasing at the boundary of the extracted regions. This aliasing is especially visible when the dataset is visualized using direct volume rendering. Our algorithm uses the binary mask only to locate the boundary. The main idea of the algorithm is to retain the natural fuzziness at the boundary of a region even after it is extracted. To achieve that, intensities of the boundary voxels are flipped so that they are now representing a fuzzy boundary with the empty region surrounding it, while preserving the boundary position.",Sarang Lakare;Arie E.

At the same time, standard computer hardware is becoming sufficiently powerful to be used in applications which previously required expensive and inflexible special-purpose hardware. We present an efficient volume rendering approach using the example of maximum intensity projection (MIP), which is an important clinical tool. The method systematically exploits the properties of general-purpose hardware such as hierarchical cache memories and super-scalar processing. In order to optimize the cache efficiency, the dataset is processed in blocks which fit into the processor cache. The innermost ray casting loop is transformed such that the arithmetic operations and memory accesses can be processed in parallel on current general-purpose processors. Combined with other optimization strategies, such as vectorization and block-wise ray skipping, this approach yields near-interactive frame rates for large clinical datasets using a standard dual-processor PC. Data compression and simplification methods have intentionally not been used in order to demonstrate the achievable performance without any quality reductions.

EuroVis,2003,Interaction of Light and Tensor Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym03/157-166,"We present three new ways of looking at tensor volumes. All three methods are based on the interaction of simulated light and the tensor field. Conceptually, rays are shot from a certain direction into the tensor volume. These rays are influenced by the surrounding tensor field and bent as they traverse through the volume. The tensor is visualized by both the nature of the bent rays and by the collection of rays deposited on a receiving plate. The former is similar to streamlines, but shows paths of greatest influence by the tensor field. The latter is similar to caustic effects from photon maps, but shows the convergence or divergence of the rays through the tensor volume. We also use the concept of treating the tensor volume as a special lens that distorts an image. Using backward ray tracing through the tensor volume, we generate image distortions that also show internal properties of the tensor field. A key advantage of these techniques is that they can work directly with non-symmetric tensor fields without first decomposing them into components.

A contour in a bivariate quadratic function defined over a triangle in parameter space is a conic section and can be represented by a rational-quadratic function, while in physical space it is a rational quartic. An isosurface in the trivariate case is represented as a rational-quadratic patch in parameter space and a rational-quartic patch in physical space.

Overall, the proposed method produces centerlines that are object-centered, connected, one voxel thick, robust with respect to object noisiness, handles arbitrary object topologies, comes with a simple pruning threshold, and is fast to compute.

We use Markov Random Field (MRF) texture synthesis methods to generate the visualization from a set of sample textures. MRF texture synthesis methods allow generating images that are locally similar to a given example image. We extend this idea for vector field visualization by identifying each vector value with a representative example image, e.g. a strongly directed texture that is rotated according to a 2D vector. The visualization is synthesized pixel by pixel, where each pixel is chosen from the sample texture according to the vector values of the local pixel. The visualization locally communicates the vector information as each pixel is chosen from a sample that is representative of the vector. Furthermore it is smooth, as MRF texture synthesis searches for best fitting neighborhoods. This leads to dense and smooth visualizations with the additional freedom to use arbitrary representation textures for any vector value.",Francesca Taponecco;Marc Alexa,

Inflow/outflow matching supports the simultaneous extraction of topologically significant inflow and outflow separatrices in a single pass. An adaptive sampling approach is introduced and used to seed streamlines in a more meaningful and efficient manner. Cell-locking is a new concept that isolates regions of a data set that do not contain separatrices. This concept makes streamline propagation more efficient as streamlines are not propagated through cells that do not influence or contain separatrices.

The number of samples, in turn, depends on the resolution of the final image. Hence, viewing the volume at high magnification will incur heavy computation. In this paper, we explore an approach that limits the number of samples to the resolution of the volume, independent of the magnification factor, using a cheap post-convolution process on the interpolated samples to generate the missing samples. For X-ray, this post-convolution is needed only once, after the volume is fully projected, while in full volume rendering, the post-convolution must be applied before each shading and compositing step. Using this technique, we are able to achieve speedups of two and more, without compromising rendering quality.

We also outline how to utilize the proposed volumetric clipping approach for the display of segmented data sets. Moreover, we increase the rendering quality by implementing efficient over-sampling with the pixel shader of consumer graphics accelerators. We give prove that at least 4-times over-sampling is needed to reconstruct the ray integral with sufficient accuracy even with pre-integration.

When visualization aims at supporting the analysis of such data sets, feature-based approches are very useful to reduce the amount of data which is shown at each instance of time and guide the user to the most interesting areas of the data. When using feature-based visualization, one of the most difficult questions is how to extract or specify the features. This is mostly done (semi-)automatic up to now. Especially when interactive analysis of the data is the main goal of the visualization, tools supporting interactive specification of features are needed.In this paper we present a framework for fiexible and interactive specification of high-dimensional and/or complex features in simulation data. The framework makes use of multiple, linked views from information as well as scienti c visualization and is based on a simple and compact feature definition language (FDL). It allows the definition of one or several features, which can be complex and/or hierarchically described by brushing multiple dimensions (using non-binary and composite brushes). The result of the specification is linked to all views, thereby a focus+context style of visualization in 3D is realized.

Determining if a dataset satisfies an algorithm's assumptions, or the criteria to be used in an analysis are both non-trivial tasks. The use of a dataset's statistical signatures, local higher order moments (LHOMs), to characterize its salient iso-values was presented in [10]. In this paper we propose a computational algorithm that uses LHOMs for expedient estimation of salient iso-values. As LHOMs are model independent statistical signatures our algorithm does not impose any assumptions on the data.

Each sub volume that is intersected by an iso-surface is projected to the image plane. A local ray casting step within the sub volume is performed for each pixel covered by the projection. Cell-based first-hit ray casting is perfectly suited whenever fast perspective iso-surfacing is required.

In this paper, we present the implementation and impact of certain measures that seek to address these shortcomings. Specifically, we investigate the effects of: (i) post-interpolated classification and shading, (ii) matched volume sampling on zoom, (iii) the interpolation of intermediate slices to reduce inter-slice aliasing, and (iv) the re-use of encoded RLE runs for more than one major viewing direction to preserve memory.

The basic idea is to minimize a three-component global error function penalizing the density and gradient errors and the curvature of the unknown filtered function. The optimization problem leads to a large linear equation system defined by a sparse coefficient matrix. We will show that such an equation system can be efficiently solved in frequency domain using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). For the sake of clarity, first we illustrate our method on a 2D example which is a dedithering problem. Afterwards the 3D extension is discussed in detail since we propose our method mainly for volume filtering. We will show that the 3D version can be efficiently used for elimination of the typical staircase artifacts of direct volume rendering without losing fine details. Unlike local filtering techniques, our novel approach ensures a⋅global smoothing effect. Previous global 3D methods are restricted to binary volumes or segmented iso-surfaces and they are based on area minimization of one single reconstructed surface. In contrast, our method is a general volume-filtering technique, implicitly smoothing all the iso-surfaces at the same time.

Corresponding color maps are either selected regardless of the actual physical color of the volume (i.e. greyscale) or predetermined as in photographic volumes. Rarely has the voxel color been used as a means to define the associated opacity value. By using transfer functions that map multi-channel color values(RGB or CIE L*u*v*) to opacity, we can generate compelling and informative renderings that provide consistent boundary extraction throughout the volume. We present renderings of the Visible Human photographic volume using multi-dimensional color-based transfer functions.

Higher-order simplicial elements can approximate data better than linear elements. Thus, fewer quadratic elements are required to achieve similar approximation quality. We use quadratic basis functions and compute best quadratic simplicial spline approximations that are C0-continuous everywhere. We adaptively refine a simplicial approximation by identifying and bisecting simplicial elements with largest errors. It is possible to store multiple approximation levels of increasing quality. We have tested the suitability and efficiency of our hierarchical data approximation scheme by applying it to several data sets.",David F. Wiley;Henry R. Childs;Bernd Hamann;Kenneth I. Joy;Nelson L.

EuroVis,2002,Bag-of-Particles as a Deformable Model,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/141-150,"We present an interactive, physically-based, elastically deformable model using a particle system to model surfaces with interior volumes that can be haptically felt. Oriented particles used in existing surface-only models, and unoriented particles used in volume-only simulations are combined to form a bag-of-particles. Multiple species of surface and volume particles, coupled with prede£ned interspecies parameters, determine the elastic properties of a bag. Starting with an object represented as a 3D voxel bitmap of connected components, the gradient of its distance map gives a vector £eld, or gradient map, that captures the static shape of an object and provides shape-maintaining forces. The gradient map enables the user to de£ne the geometry of the simulated objects, and provides feedback reaction forces allowing a user to feel the model. A bag-of-particles model can simulate several objects in the same scene, as well as objects composed of different materials, such as organs with multiple tissue types. We demonstrate the bag-of-particles approach using a number of different data sources, and apply it to modeling myocardium dynamics.",David J. Stahl Jr.;Norberto Ezquerra;Greg Turk,
EuroVis,2002,A Continuous Skeletonization Method Based on Level Sets,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/151-157,"A robust and efficient method in 2D and 3D for the calculation of skeletons for arbitrary objects is presented. The method is based on the calculation of the distance function with respect to the object boundary. This is combined, in a post processing step, with a new indicator to identify the skeleton, which coincides with the singularity set of the distance map. The indicator is defined as a suitable function of certain local momenta of this distance map and allows a robust and accurate computation of the distance from the skeleton set. This distance is then extended, again via the level set method, onto the whole space. Several applications in 2D and 3D are presented.",Martin Rumpf;Alexandru C. Telea,
EuroVis,2002,Visualization of Bibliographic Networks with a Reshaped Landscape Metaphor,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/159-164,"We describe a novel approach to visualize bibliographic networks that facilitates the simultaneous identification of clusters (e.g., topic areas) and prominent entities (e.g., surveys or landmark papers). While employing the landscape metaphor proposed in several earlier works, we introduce new means to determine relevant parameters of the landscape. Moreover, we are able to compute prominent entities, clustering of entities, and the landscape's surface in a surprisingly simple and uniform way. The effectiveness of our network visualizations is illustrated on data from the graph drawing literature.",Ulrik Brandes;Thomas Willhalm,
EuroVis,2002,Secondary Task Display Attributes - Optimizing Visualizations for Cognitive Task Suitability and Interference Avoidance,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/165-171,"We found that established display design guidelines for focal images cannot be extended to images displayed as a secondary task in a dual-task situation. This paper describes an experiment that determines a new ordering guideline for secondary task image attributes according to human cognitive ability to extract information. The imperative for alternate guidelines is based on the difference in an image's ability to convey meaning, which decreases when moved from a focal to a secondary task situation. Secondary task attribute ordering varies with the level of degradation in the primary task. Furthermore, attribute effectiveness may be particular to types of visual operations relating to cognitive tasks.",Christa M. Chewar;D.

EuroVis,2002,Visualizing and Investigating Multidimensional Functions,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/173-182,"This paper addresses the problem of visualizing multidimensional scalar functions. These functions are often encountered in fields such as Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics to understand and model complex phenomena. We propose a novel method based on the dimension reduction philosophy called HyperCell. Its basic concept is to represent the function by means of dynamic orthogonal low (1D, 2D, or 3D) dimensional subspaces, called Cells. Firstly the user defines a N-dimensional region of interest, in which the data can be visualized. Then the user interactively creates cells by selecting up to three dimensions from the function domain. A cell can be visualized using a standard visualization algorithm such as isosurfacing or volume rendering. The analysis of the function is done by investigating several cells, which can be sampled simultaneously at different regions of interest in N-Space. The HyperCell method allows several useful operations to help the exploratory process such as navigation and rotation in N-Space, and brushing.",Selan R. dos Santos;Ken W. Brodlie,
EuroVis,2002,Viewpoint Entropy: A New Tool for Obtaining Good Views of Molecules,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/183-188,"The computation of good viewpoints is important in several fields: computer graphics, removal of degeneracies in computational geometry, robotics, graph drawing, etc. However, in areas such as computer graphics there is no consensus on what a good viewpoint means and, consequently, each author uses his or her own definition according to the requirements of the application. In this paper we present a formal measure strongly based on Information Theory, viewpoint entropy, that can be applied to certain problems of Computer Graphics such as automatic exploration of objects or scenes and Scene Understanding. We also define a new measure, the orthogonal frustum entropy, in order to fulfill the requirements needed to visualize molecules. We design an algorithm that makes use of graphics hardware to accelerate computation, and whose complexity depends mainly on the number of views we want to analyze. Computation of good views of molecules is useful for molecular scientists, a field which includes practitioners from Crystallography, Chemistry, and Biology.",Pere-Pau Vázquez;Miquel Feixas;Mateu Sbert;Antoni Llobet,

However, the analysis of these models has not benefited from recent advancements in volume visualization. This case study applies the ideas and techniques from multi-dimensional transfer function based volume rendering to the multivariate weather simulations. The specific goal of identifying frontal zones is addressed. By combining temperature and humidity as a multivariate field, the frontal zones are more readily identified thereby assisting the meteorologists in their analysis tasks.",Joe Kniss;Charles D.

EuroVis,2002,Speech and Gesture Multimodal Control of a Whole Earth 3D Visualization Environment,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/195-200,"A growing body of research shows several advantages to multimodal interfaces including increased expressiveness, flexibility, and user freedom. This paper investigates the design of such an interface that integrates speech and hand gestures. The interface has the additional property of operating relative to the user and can be used while the user is in motion or standing at a distance from the computer display. The paper then describes an implementation of the multimodal interface for a whole Earth 3D visualization which presents navigation interface challenges due to the large magnitude of scale and extended spaces that are available. The characteristics of the multimodal interface are examined, such as speed, recognizability of gestures, ease and accuracy of use, and learnability under likely conditions of use. This implementation shows that such a multimodal interface can be effective in a real environment and sets some parameters for the design and use of such interfaces.",David M.

This paper describes Web Access Visualization (WAV) a system that visually associates the affinities and relationships of clients and URLs for large volumes of web transaction data. To date, many practical research projects have shown the usefulness of a physics-based mass-spring technique to layout data items with close relationships onto a graph. The WAV system: (1) maps transaction data items (clients, URLs) and their relationships to vertices, edges, and positions on a 3D spherical surface; (2) encapsulates a physics-based engine in a visual data analysis platform; and (3) employs various content sensitive visual techniques - linked multiple views, layered drill-down, and fade in/out - for interactive data analysis. We have applied this system to a web application to analyze web access patterns and trends. The web service quality has been greatly benefited from using the information provided by WAV.",Ming C.

EuroVis,2002,Useful Properties of Semantic Depth of Field for Better F+C Visualization,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/205-210,"This paper presents the results of a thorough user study that was performed to assess some features and the general usefulness of Semantic Depth of Field (SDOF). Based on these results, concrete hints are given on how SDOF can be used for visualization. SDOF was found to be a very effective means for guiding the viewer's attention and for giving him or her a quick overview of a data set. It can also very quickly be perceived, and therefore provides an efficient visual channel.Semantic Depth of Field is a focus+context (F+C) technique that uses blur to point the user to the most relevant objects. It was inspired by the depth of field (DOF) effect in photography, which serves a very similar purpose.",Robert Kosara;Silvia Miksch;Helwig Hauser,
EuroVis,2002,An Evaluation of Information Visualization in Attention-Limited Environments,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/211-216,"People often need to quickly access or maintain awareness of secondary information while busy with other primary tasks. Information visualizations provide rapid, effective access to information, but are generally designed to be examined by users as the primary focus of their attention. The goal of this research is to discover how to design information visualizations intended for the periphery and to understand how quickly and effectively people can interpret information visualizations while they are busily performing other tasks. We evaluated how several factors of a visualization (visual density, presence time, and secondary task type) impact people's abilities to continue with a primary task and to complete secondary tasks related to the visualization. Our results suggest that, with relaxed time pressure, reduced visual information density and a single well-defined secondary task, people can effectively interpret visualizations with minimal distraction to their primary task.",Jacob P.

These ideas originated from Sperner's lemma, which by itself is of little value to detecting vortex cores. However, we take these ideas from the lemma and apply them in a point-based fashion to detecting vortex core regions. The resulting algorithms for both 2D and 3D are quite simple and very efficient compared to existing ones. We applied our algorithms to both numerically simulated and procedurally generated datasets to illustrate the efficacy of our approach.",Ming Jiang 0005;Raghu Machiraju;David S. Thompson,
EuroVis,2002,Locating Closed Streamlines in 3D Vector Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/227-232,The analysis and visualization of flows is a central problem in visualization. Topology based methods have gained increasing interest in recent years. This article describes a method for the detection of closed streamlines in 3D flows. It is based on a special treatment of cases where a streamline reenters a cell to prevent infinite cycling during streamline calculation. The algorithm checks for possible exits of a loop of crossed faces and detects structurally stable closed streamlines. These global features are not detected by conventional topology and feature detection algorithms.,Thomas Wischgoll;Gerik Scheuermann,

We show that the field of flow visualization can benefit from these techniques, too, yielding more coherent features and sorting out numerical artifacts as well as irrelevant large-scale features. We describe an implementation of scale-space computation using finite elements and show that performance is sufficient for computing a scale-space of time-dependent CFD data. Feature tracking, if available, allows to process the information provided by scale-space not just visually but also algorithmically. We present a technique for extending a class of feature extraction schemes by an additional dimension, resulting in an efficient solution of the tracking problem.",Dirk Bauer;Ronald Peikert,

We augment the Fast Marching Method (FMM) widely used in level set applications by computing the paramterized boundary location every pixel came from during the boundary evolution. The resulting parameter field is then thresholded to produce the skeleton branches created by boundary features of a given size. The presented algorithm is straightforward to implement, has low memory costs and short execution times, and is robust with respect to the used threshold and initial shape noisiness. The produced skeletons are very similar to the ones delivered by more complex algorithms. Various 2D and 3D applications are presented.",Alexandru C. Telea;Jarke J. van Wijk,
