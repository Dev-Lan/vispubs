EuroVis,2023,Mini-VLAT: A Short and Effective Measure of Visualization Literacy,10.1111/cgf.14809,"The visualization community regards visualization literacy as a necessary skill. Yet, despite the recent increase in research into visualization literacy by the education and visualization communities, we lack practical and time‐effective instruments for the widespread measurements of people's comprehension and interpretation of visual designs. We present Mini‐VLAT, a brief but practical visualization literacy test. The Mini‐VLAT is a 12‐item short form of the 53‐item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT). The Mini‐VLAT is reliable (coefficient omega = 0.72) and strongly correlates with the VLAT. Five visualization experts validated the Mini‐VLAT items, yielding an average content validity ratio (CVR) of 0.6. We further validate Mini‐VLAT by demonstrating a strong positive correlation between study participants' Mini‐VLAT scores and their aptitude for learning an unfamiliar visualization using a Parallel Coordinate Plot test. Overall, the Mini‐VLAT items showed a similar pattern of validity and reliability as the 53‐item VLAT. The results show that Mini‐VLAT is a psychometrically sound and practical short measure of visualization literacy.",Saugat Pandey; Alvitta Ottley,
EuroVis,2023,ChemoGraph: Interactive Visual Exploration of the Chemical Space,10.1111/cgf.14807,"Exploratory analysis of the chemical space is an important task in the field of cheminformatics. For example, in drug discovery research, chemists investigate sets of thousands of chemical compounds in order to identify novel yet structurally similar synthetic compounds to replace natural products. Manually exploring the chemical space inhabited by all possible molecules and chemical compounds is impractical, and therefore presents a challenge. To fill this gap, we present ChemoGraph, a novel visual analytics technique for interactively exploring related chemicals. In ChemoGraph, we formalize a chemical space as a hypergraph and apply novel machine learning models to compute related chemical compounds. It uses a database to find related compounds from a known space and a machine learning model to generate new ones, which helps enlarge the known space. Moreover, ChemoGraph highlights interactive features that support users in viewing, comparing, and organizing computationally identified related chemicals. With a drug discovery usage scenario and initial expert feedback from a case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of ChemoGraph.",Bharat Kale; Austin Clyde; Maoyuan Sun; Arvind Ramanathan; Rick L.

EuroVis,2023,A Fully Integrated Pipeline for Visual Carotid Morphology Analysis,10.1111/cgf.14808,"Analyzing stenoses of the internal carotids – local constrictions of the artery – is a critical clinical task in cardiovascular disease treatment and prevention. For this purpose, we propose a self‐contained pipeline for the visual analysis of carotid artery geometries. The only inputs are computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans, which are already recorded in clinical routine. We show how integrated model extraction and visualization can help to efficiently detect stenoses and we provide means for automatic, highly accurate stenosis degree computation. We directly connect multiple sophisticated processing stages, including a neural prediction network for lumen and plaque segmentation and automatic global diameter computation. We enable interactive and retrospective user control over the processing stages. Our aims are to increase user trust by making the underlying data validatable on the fly, to decrease adoption costs by minimizing external dependencies, and to optimize scalability by streamlining the data processing. We use interactive visualizations for data inspection and adaption to guide the user through the processing stages. The framework was developed and evaluated in close collaboration with radiologists and neurologists. It has been used to extract and analyze over 100 carotid bifurcation geometries and is built with a modular architecture, available as an extendable open‐source platform.",Pepe Eulzer; Fabienne von Deylen; Chan-Wei Hsu; Ralph Wickenhöfer; Carsten M.

EuroVis,2023,"Doppler Volume Rendering: A Dynamic, Piecewise Linear Spectral Representation for Visualizing Astrophysics Simulations",10.1111/cgf.14810,"We present a novel approach for rendering volumetric data including the Doppler effect of light. Similar to the acoustic Doppler effect, which is caused by relative motion between a sound emitter and an observer, light waves also experience compression or expansion when emitter and observer exhibit relative motion. We account for this by employing spectral volume rendering in an emission–absorption model, with the volumetric matter moving according to an accompanying vector field, and emitting and attenuating light at wavelengths subject to the Doppler effect. By introducing a novel piecewise linearear representation of the involved light spectra, we achieve accurate volume rendering at interactive frame rates. We compare our technique to rendering with traditional point‐based spectral representation, and demonstrate its utility using a simulation of galaxy formation.",Reem Alghamdi; Thomas Müller 0005; Alberto Jaspe Villanueva; Markus Hadwiger; Filip Sadlo,
EuroVis,2023,Memory-Efficient GPU Volume Path Tracing of AMR Data Using the Dual Mesh,10.1111/cgf.14811,"A common way to render cell‐centric adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data is to compute the dual mesh and visualize that with a standard unstructured element renderer. While the dual mesh provides a high‐quality interpolator, the memory requirements of the dual mesh data structure are significantly higher than those of the original grid, which prevents rendering very large data sets. We introduce a GPU‐friendly data structure and a clustering algorithm that allow for efficient AMR dual mesh rendering with a competitive memory footprint. Fundamentally, any off‐the‐shelf unstructured element renderer running on GPUs could be extended to support our data structure just by adding a gridlet element type in addition to the standard tetrahedra, pyramids, wedges, and hexahedra supported by default. We integrated the data structure into a volumetric path tracer to compare it to various state‐of‐the‐art unstructured element sampling methods. We show that our data structure easily competes with these methods in terms of rendering performance, but is much more memory‐efficient.",Stefan Zellmann; Qi Wu 0015; Kwan-Liu Ma; Ingo Wald,
EuroVis,2023,xOpat: eXplainable Open Pathology Analysis Tool,10.1111/cgf.14812,"Histopathology research quickly evolves thanks to advances in whole slide imaging (WSI) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing WSI viewers are tailored either for clinical or research environments, but none suits both. This hinders the adoption of new methods and communication between the researchers and clinicians. The paper presents xOpat, an open‐source, browser‐based WSI viewer that addresses these problems. xOpat supports various data sources, such as tissue images, pathologists' annotations, or additional data produced by AI models. Furthermore, it provides efficient rendering of multiple data layers, their visual representations, and tools for annotating and presenting findings. Thanks to its modular, protocol‐agnostic, and extensible architecture, xOpat can be easily integrated into different environments and thus helps to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice. To demonstrate the utility of xOpat, we present three case studies, one conducted with a developer of AI algorithms for image segmentation and two with a research pathologist.",Jirí Horák; Katarína Furmanová; Barbora Kozlíková; Tomás Brázdil; Petr Holub; Martin Kacenga; Matej Gallo; Rudolf Nenutil; Jan Byska; Vít Rusnák,
EuroVis,2023,Process and Pitfalls of Online Teaching and Learning with Design Study ''Lite'' Methodology: A Retrospective Analysis,10.1111/cgf.14813,"Design studies are an integral method of visualization research with hundreds of instances in the literature. Although taught as a theory, the practical implementation of design studies is often excluded from visualization pedagogy due to the lengthy time commitments associated with such studies. Recent research has addressed this challenge and developed an expedited design study framework, the Design Study “Lite” Methodology (DSLM), which can implement design studies with novice students within just 14 weeks. The framework was developed and evaluated based on five semesters of in‐person data visualization courses with 30 students or less and was implemented in conjunction with Service‐Learning (S‐L). With the growth and popularity of the data visualization field—and the teaching environment created by the COVID‐19 pandemic—more academic institutions are offering visualization courses online. Therefore, in this paper, we strengthen and validate the epistemological foundations of the DSLM framework by testing its (1) adaptability to online learning environments and conditions and (2) scalability to larger classes with up to 57 students. We present two online implementations of the DSLM framework, with and without Service‐Learning (S‐L), to test the adaptability and scalability of the framework. We further demonstrate that the framework can be applied effectively without the S‐L component. We reflect on our experience with the online DSLM implementations and contribute a detailed retrospective analysis using thematic analysis and grounded theory methods to draw valuable recommendations and guidelines for future applications of the framework. This work verifies that DSLM can be used successfully in online classes to teach design study methodology. Finally, we contribute novel additions to the DSLM framework to further enhance it for teaching and learning design studies in the classroom.

EuroVis,2023,RectEuler: Visualizing Intersecting Sets using Rectangles,10.1111/cgf.14814,"Euler diagrams are a popular technique to visualize set‐typed data. However, creating diagrams using simple shapes remains a challenging problem for many complex, real‐life datasets. To solve this, we propose RectEuler: a flexible, fully‐automatic method using rectangles to create Euler‐like diagrams. We use an efficient mixed‐integer optimization scheme to place set labels and element representatives (e.g., text or images) in conjunction with rectangles describing the sets. By defining appropriate constraints, we adhere to well‐formedness properties and aesthetic considerations. If a dataset cannot be created within a reasonable time or at all, we iteratively split the diagram into multiple components until a drawable solution is found. Redundant encoding of the set membership using dots and set lines improves the readability of the diagram. Our web tool lets users see how the layout changes throughout the optimization process and provides interactive explanations. For evaluation, we perform quantitative and qualitative analysis across different datasets and compare our method to state‐of‐the‐art Euler diagram generation methods.",Patrick Paetzold; Rebecca Kehlbeck; Hendrik Strobelt; Yumeng Xue; Sabine Storandt; Oliver Deussen,
EuroVis,2023,Data Stories of Water: Studying the Communicative Role of Data Visualizations within Long-form Journalism,10.1111/cgf.14815,"We present a methodology for making sense of the communicative role of data visualizations in journalistic storytelling and share findings from surveying water‐related data stories. Data stories are a genre of long‐form journalism that integrate text, data visualization, and other visual expressions (e.g., photographs, illustrations, videos) for the purpose of data‐driven storytelling. In the last decade, a considerable number of data stories about a wide range of topics have been published worldwide. Authors use a variety of techniques to make complex phenomena comprehensible and use visualizations as communicative devices that shape the understanding of a given topic. Despite the popularity of data stories, we, as scholars, still lack a methodological framework for assessing the communicative role of visualizations in data stories. To this extent, we draw from data journalism, visual culture, and multimodality studies to propose an interpretative framework in six stages. The process begins with the analysis of content blocks and framing elements and ends with the identification of dimensions, patterns, and relationships between textual and visual elements. The framework is put to the test by analyzing 17 data stories about water‐related issues. Our observations from the survey illustrate how data visualizations can shape the framing of complex topics.",Manuela Garretón; Francesca Morini; Daniela Paz Moyano; Gianna-Carina Grün; Denis Parra,
EuroVis,2023,Belief Decay or Persistence? A Mixed-method Study on Belief Movement Over Time,10.1111/cgf.14816,"When individuals encounter new information (data), that information is incorporated with their existing beliefs (prior) to form a new belief (posterior) in a process referred to as belief updating. While most studies on rational belief updating in visual data analysis elicit beliefs immediately after data is shown, we posit that there may be critical movement in an individual's beliefs when elicited immediately after data is shown v. after a temporal delay (e.g., due to forgetfulness or weak incorporation of the data). Our paper investigates the hypothesis that posterior beliefs elicited after a time interval will “decay” back towards the prior beliefs compared to the posterior beliefs elicited immediately after new data is presented. In this study, we recruit 101 participants to complete three tasks where beliefs are elicited immediately after seeing new data and again after a brief distractor task. We conduct (1) a quantitative analysis of the results to understand if there are any systematic differences in beliefs elicited immediately after seeing new data or after a distractor task and (2) a qualitative analysis of participants' reflections on the reasons for their belief update. While we find no statistically significant global trends across the participants beliefs elicited immediately v. after the delay, the qualitative analysis provides rich insight into the reasons for an individual's belief movement across 9 prototypical scenarios, which includes (i) decay of beliefs as a result of either forgetting the information shown or strongly held prior beliefs, (ii) strengthening of confidence in updated beliefs by positively integrating the new data and (iii) maintaining a consistently updated belief over time, among others. These results can guide subsequent experiments to disambiguate when and by what mechanism new data is truly incorporated into one's belief system.",Shrey Gupta; Alireza Karduni; Emily Wall,
EuroVis,2023,Do Disease Stories need a Hero? Effects of Human Protagonists on a Narrative Visualization about Cerebral Small Vessel Disease,10.1111/cgf.14817,"Authors use various media formats to convey disease information to a broad audience, from articles and videos to interviews or documentaries. These media often include human characters, such as patients or treating physicians, who are involved with the disease. While artistic media, such as hand‐crafted illustrations and animations are used for health communication in many cases, our goal is to focus on data‐driven visualizations. Over the last decade, narrative visualization has experienced increasing prominence, employing storytelling techniques to present data in an understandable way. Similar to classic storytelling formats, narrative medical visualizations may also take a human character‐centered design approach. However, the impact of this form of data communication on the user is largely unexplored. This study investigates the protagonist's influence on user experience in terms of engagement, identification, self‐referencing, emotional response, perceived credibility, and time spent in the story. Our experimental setup utilizes a character‐driven story structure for disease stories derived from Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. Using this structure, we generated three conditions for a cerebral small vessel disease story that vary by their protagonist: (1) a patient, (2) a physician, and (3) a base condition with no human protagonist. These story variants formed the basis for our hypotheses on the effect of a human protagonist in disease stories, which we evaluated in an online study with 30 participants. Our findings indicate that a human protagonist exerts various influences on the story perception and that these also vary depending on the type of protagonist.",Sarah Mittenentzwei; Veronika Weiß; Stefanie Schreiber; Laura A.

EuroVis,2023,Don't Peek at My Chart: Privacy-preserving Visualization for Mobile Devices,10.1111/cgf.14818,"Data visualizations have been widely used on mobile devices like smartphones for various tasks (e.g., visualizing personal health and financial data), making it convenient for people to view such data anytime and anywhere. However, others nearby can also easily peek at the visualizations, resulting in personal data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a perception‐driven approach to transform mobile data visualizations into privacy‐preserving ones. Specifically, based on human visual perception, we develop a masking scheme to adjust the spatial frequency and luminance contrast of colored visualizations. The resulting visualization retains its original information in close proximity but reduces visibility when viewed from a certain distance or farther away. We conducted two user studies to inform the design of our approach (N=16) and systematically evaluate its performance (N=18), respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of privacy preservation for mobile data visualizations.",Songheng Zhang; Dong Ma 0001; Yong Wang 0021,
EuroVis,2023,VisCoMET: Visually Analyzing Team Collaboration in Medical Emergency Trainings,10.1111/cgf.14819,"Handling emergencies requires efficient and effective collaboration of medical professionals. To analyze their performance, in an application study, we have developed VisCoMET, a visual analytics approach displaying interactions of healthcare personnel in a triage training of a mass casualty incident. The application scenario stems from social interaction research, where the collaboration of teams is studied from different perspectives. We integrate recorded annotations from multiple sources, such as recorded videos of the sessions, transcribed communication, and eye‐tracking information. For each session, an information‐rich timeline visualizes events across these different channels, specifically highlighting interactions between the team members. We provide algorithmic support to identify frequent event patterns and to search for user‐defined event sequences. Comparing different teams, an overview visualization aggregates each training session in a visual glyph as a node, connected to similar sessions through edges. An application example shows the usage of the approach in the comparative analysis of triage training sessions, where multiple teams encountered the same scene, and highlights discovered insights. The approach was evaluated through feedback from visualization and social interaction experts. The results show that the approach supports reflecting on teams' performance by exploratory analysis of collaboration behavior while particularly enabling the comparison of triage training sessions.",Carina Liebers; Shivam Agarwal; Maximilian Krug; Karola Pitsch; Fabian Beck 0001,
EuroVis,2023,FlexEvent: going beyond Case-Centric Exploration and Analysis of Multivariate Event Sequences,10.1111/cgf.14820,"In many domains, multivariate event sequence data is collected focused around an entity (the case). Typically, each event has multiple attributes, for example, in healthcare a patient has events such as hospitalization, medication, and surgery. In addition to the multivariate events, also the case (a specific attribute, e.g., patient) has associated multivariate data (e.g., age, gender, weight). Current work typically only visualizes one attribute per event (label) in the event sequences. As a consequence, events can only be explored from a predefined case‐centric perspective. However, to find complex relations from multiple perspectives (e.g., from different case definitions, such as doctor), users also need an event‐ and attribute‐centric perspective. In addition, support is needed to effortlessly switch between and within perspectives. To support such a rich exploration, we present FlexEvent: an exploration and analysis method that enables investigation beyond a fixed case‐centric perspective. Based on an adaptation of existing visualization techniques, such as scatterplots and juxtaposed small multiples, we enable flexible switching between different perspectives to explore the multivariate event sequence data needed to answer multi‐perspective hypotheses. We evaluated FlexEvent with three domain experts in two use cases with sleep disorder and neonatal ICU data that show our method facilitates experts in exploring and analyzing real‐world multivariate sequence data from different perspectives.",Sanne van der Linden; Bernice M.

EuroVis,2023,A Comparative Evaluation of Visual Summarization Techniques for Event Sequences,10.1111/cgf.14821,"Real‐world event sequences are often complex and heterogeneous, making it difficult to create meaningful visualizations using simple data aggregation and visual encoding techniques. Consequently, visualization researchers have developed numerous visual summarization techniques to generate concise overviews of sequential data. These techniques vary widely in terms of summary structures and contents, and currently there is a knowledge gap in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques. In this work, we present the design and results of an insight‐based crowdsourcing experiment evaluating three existing visual summarization techniques: CoreFlow, SentenTree, and Sequence Synopsis. We compare the visual summaries generated by these techniques across three tasks, on six datasets, at six levels of granularity. We analyze the effects of these variables on summary quality as rated by participants and completion time of the experiment tasks. Our analysis shows that Sequence Synopsis produces the highest‐quality visual summaries for all three tasks, but understanding Sequence Synopsis results also takes the longest time. We also find that the participants evaluate visual summary quality based on two aspects: content and interpretability. We discuss the implications of our findings on developing and evaluating new visual summarization techniques.",Kazi Tasnim Zinat; Jinhua Yang; Arjun Gandhi; Nistha Mitra; Zhicheng Liu,
EuroVis,2023,Ferret: Reviewing Tabular Datasets for Manipulation,10.1111/cgf.14822,"How do we ensure the veracity of science? The act of manipulating or fabricating scientific data has led to many high‐profile fraud cases and retractions. Detecting manipulated data, however, is a challenging and time‐consuming endeavor. Automated detection methods are limited due to the diversity of data types and manipulation techniques. Furthermore, patterns automatically flagged as suspicious can have reasonable explanations. Instead, we propose a nuanced approach where experts analyze tabular datasets, e.g., as part of the peer‐review process, using a guided, interactive visualization approach. In this paper, we present an analysis of how manipulated datasets are created and the artifacts these techniques generate. Based on these findings, we propose a suite of visualization methods to surface potential irregularities. We have implemented these methods in Ferret, a visualization tool for data forensics work. Ferret makes potential data issues salient and provides guidance on spotting signs of tampering and differentiating them from truthful data.",Devin Lange; Shaurya Sahai; Jeff M.

EuroVis,2023,Human-Computer Collaboration for Visual Analytics: an Agent-based Framework,10.1111/cgf.14823,"The visual analytics community has long aimed to understand users better and assist them in their analytic endeavors. As a result, numerous conceptual models of visual analytics aim to formalize common workflows, techniques, and goals leveraged by analysts. While many of the existing approaches are rich in detail, they each are specific to a particular aspect of the visual analytic process. Furthermore, with an ever‐expanding array of novel artificial intelligence techniques and advances in visual analytic settings, existing conceptual models may not provide enough expressivity to bridge the two fields. In this work, we propose an agent‐based conceptual model for the visual analytic process by drawing parallels from the artificial intelligence literature. We present three examples from the visual analytics literature as case studies and examine them in detail using our framework. Our simple yet robust framework unifies the visual analytic pipeline to enable researchers and practitioners to reason about scenarios that are becoming increasingly prominent in the field, namely mixed‐initiative, guided, and collaborative analysis. Furthermore, it will allow us to characterize analysts, visual analytic settings, and guidance from the lenses of human agents, environments, and artificial agents, respectively.",Shayan Monadjemi; Mengtian Guo; David Gotz; Roman Garnett; Alvitta Ottley,
EuroVis,2023,Exploring Interpersonal Relationships in Historical Voting Records,10.1111/cgf.14824,"Historical records from democratic processes and negotiation of constitutional texts are a complex type of data to navigate due to the many different elements that are constantly interacting with one another: people, timelines, different proposed documents, changes to such documents, and voting to approve or reject those changes. In particular, voting records can offer various insights about relationships between people of note in that historical context, such as alliances that can form and dissolve over time and people with unusual behavior. In this paper, we present a toolset developed to aid users in exploring relationships in voting records from a particular domain of constitutional conventions. The toolset consists of two elements: a dataset visualizer, which shows the entire timeline of a convention and allows users to investigate relationships at different moments in time via dimensionality reduction, and a person visualizer, which shows details of a given person's activity in that convention to aid in understanding the behavior observed in the dataset visualizer. We discuss our design choices and how each tool in those elements works towards our goals, and how they were perceived in an evaluation conducted with domain experts.",Gabriel Dias Cantareira; Yiwen Xing; Nicholas Cole; Rita Borgo; Alfie Abdul-Rahman,
EuroVis,2023,Tac-Anticipator: Visual Analytics of Anticipation Behaviors in Table Tennis Matches,10.1111/cgf.14825,"Anticipation skill is important for elite racquet sports players. Successful anticipation allows them to predict the actions of the opponent better and take early actions in matches. Existing studies of anticipation behaviors, largely based on the analysis of in‐lab behaviors, failed to capture the characteristics of in‐situ anticipation behaviors in real matches. This research proposes a data‐driven approach for research on anticipation behaviors to gain more accurate and reliable insight into anticipation skills. Collaborating with domain experts in table tennis, we develop a complete solution that includes data collection, the development of a model to evaluate anticipation behaviors, and the design of a visual analytics system called Tac‐Anticipator. Our case study reveals the strengths and weaknesses of top table tennis players' anticipation behaviors. In a word, our work enriches the research methods and guidelines for visual analytics of anticipation behaviors.",Jiachen Wang; Yihong Wu; Xiaolong Zhang 0001; Yixin Zeng; Zheng Zhou; Hui Zhang 0051; Xiao Xie; Yingcai Wu,
EuroVis,2023,Teru Teru Bozu: Defensive Raincloud Plots,10.1111/cgf.14826,"Univariate visualizations like histograms, rug plots, or box plots provide concise visual summaries of distributions. However, each individual visualization may fail to robustly distinguish important features of a distribution, or provide sufficient information for all of the relevant tasks involved in summarizing univariate data. One solution is to juxtapose or superimpose multiple univariate visualizations in the same chart, as in Allen et al.'s [APW*19] “raincloud plots.” In this paper I examine the design space of raincloud plots, and, through a series of simulation studies, explore designs where the component visualizations mutually “defend” against situations where important distribution features are missed or trivial features are given undue prominence. I suggest a class of “defensive” raincloud plot designs that provide good mutual coverage for surfacing distributional features of interest.",Michael Correll,
EuroVis,2023,VENUS: A Geometrical Representation for Quantum State Visualization,10.1111/cgf.14827,"Visualizations have played a crucial role in helping quantum computing users explore quantum states in various quantum computing applications. Among them, Bloch Sphere is the widely‐used visualization for showing quantum states, which leverages angles to represent quantum amplitudes. However, it cannot support the visualization of quantum entanglement and superposition, the two essential properties of quantum computing. To address this issue, we propose VENUS, a novel visualization for quantum state representation. By explicitly correlating 2D geometric shapes based on the math foundation of quantum computing characteristics, VENUS effectively represents quantum amplitudes of both the single qubit and two qubits for quantum entanglement. Also, we use multiple coordinated semicircles to naturally encode probability distribution, making the quantum superposition intuitive to analyze. We conducted two well‐designed case studies and an in‐depth expert interview to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of VENUS. The result shows that VENUS can effectively facilitate the exploration of quantum states for the single qubit and two qubits.",Shaolun Ruan; Ribo Yuan; Qiang Guan; Yanna Lin; Ying Mao; Weiwen Jiang; Zhepeng Wang; Wei Xu 0020; Yong Wang 0021,
EuroVis,2023,visMOP - A Visual Analytics Approach for Multi-omics Pathways,10.1111/cgf.14828,"We present an approach for the visual analysis of multi‐omics data obtained using high‐throughput methods. The term “omics” denotes measurements of different types of biologically relevant molecules like the products of gene transcription (transcriptomics) or the abundance of proteins (proteomics). Current popular visualization approaches often only support analyzing each of these omics separately. This, however, disregards the interconnectedness of different biologically relevant molecules and processes. Consequently, it describes the actual events in the organism suboptimally or only partially. Our visual analytics approach for multi‐omics data provides a comprehensive overview and details‐on‐demand by integrating the different omics types in multiple linked views. To give an overview, we map the measurements to known biological pathways and use a combination of a clustered network visualization, glyphs, and interactive filtering. To ensure the effectiveness and utility of our approach, we designed it in close collaboration with domain experts and assessed it using an exemplary workflow with real‐world transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics measurements from mice.",Nicolas Brich; Nadine Schacherer; Miriam Hoene; Cora Weigert; Rainer Lehmann; Michael Krone,
EuroVis,2023,GO-Compass: Visual Navigation of Multiple Lists of GO terms,10.1111/cgf.14829,"Analysis pipelines in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics commonly produce lists of genes, e.g., differentially expressed genes. Often these lists overlap only partly or not at all and contain too many genes for manual comparison. However, using background knowledge, such as the functional annotations of the genes, the lists can be abstracted to functional terms. One approach is to run Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to determine over‐ and/or underrepresented functions for every list of genes. Due to the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology, lists of enriched GO terms can contain many closely related terms, rendering the lists still long, redundant, and difficult to interpret for researchers.In this paper, we present GO‐Compass (Gene Ontology list comparison using Semantic Similarity), a visual analytics tool for the dispensability reduction and visual comparison of lists of GO terms. For dispensability reduction, we adapted the RE‐VIGO algorithm, a summarization method based on the semantic similarity of GO terms, to perform hierarchical dispensability clustering on multiple lists. In an interactive dashboard, GO‐Compass offers several visualizations for the comparison and improved interpretability of GO terms lists. The hierarchical dispensability clustering is visualized as a tree, where users can interactively filter out dispensable GO terms and create flat clusters by cutting the tree at a chosen dispensability. The flat clusters are visualized in animated treemaps and are compared using a correlation heatmap, UpSet plots, and bar charts. With two use cases on published datasets from different omics domains, we demonstrate the general applicability and effectiveness of our approach. In the first use case, we show how the tool can be used to compare lists of differentially expressed genes from a transcriptomics pipeline and incorporate gene information into the analysis. In the second use case using genomics data, we show how GO‐Compass facilitates the analysis of many hundreds of GO terms. For qualitative evaluation of the tool, we conducted feedback sessions with five domain experts and received positive comments.

We describe the co‐design of a modeling system, DASS, to support the hybrid human‐machine development and validation of predictive models for estimating long‐term toxicities related to radiotherapy doses in head and neck cancer patients. Developed in collaboration with domain experts in oncology and data mining, DASS incorporates human‐in‐the‐loop visual steering, spatial data, and explainable AI to augment domain knowledge with automatic data mining.

EuroVis,2023,Unfolding Edges: Adding Context to Edges in Multivariate Graph Visualization,10.1111/cgf.14831,"Existing work on visualizing multivariate graphs is primarily concerned with representing the attributes of nodes. Even though edges are the constitutive elements of networks, there have been only few attempts to visualize attributes of edges. In this work, we focus on the critical importance of edge attributes for interpreting network visualizations and building trust in the underlying data. We propose ‘unfolding of edges’ as an interactive approach to integrate multivariate edge attributes dynamically into existing node‐link diagrams. Unfolding edges is an in‐situ approach that gradually transforms basic links into detailed representations of the associated edge attributes. This approach extends focus+context, semantic zoom, and animated transitions for network visualizations to accommodate edge details on‐demand without cluttering the overall graph layout. We explore the design space for the unfolding of edges, which covers aspects of making space for the unfolding, of actually representing the edge context, and of navigating between edges. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present two case studies in the context of historical network analysis and computational social science. For these, web‐based prototypes were implemented based on which we conducted interviews with domain experts. The experts' feedback suggests that the proposed unfolding of edges is a useful tool for exploring rich edge information of multivariate graphs.",Mark-Jan Bludau; Marian Dörk; Christian Tominski,
EuroVis,2023,WYTIWYR: A User Intent-Aware Framework with Multi-modal Inputs for Visualization Retrieval,10.1111/cgf.14832,"Retrieving charts from a large corpus is a fundamental task that can benefit numerous applications such as visualization recommendations. The retrieved results are expected to conform to both explicit visual attributes (e.g., chart type, colormap) and implicit user intents (e.g., design style, context information) that vary upon application scenarios. However, existing example‐based chart retrieval methods are built upon non‐decoupled and low‐level visual features that are hard to interpret, while definition‐based ones are constrained to pre‐defined attributes that are hard to extend. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely WYTIWYR (What‐You‐Think‐Is‐What‐You‐Retrieve), that integrates user intents into the chart retrieval process. The framework consists of two stages: first, the Annotation stage disentangles the visual attributes within the query chart; and second, the Retrieval stage embeds the user's intent with customized text prompt as well as bitmap query chart, to recall targeted retrieval result. We develop aprototype WYTIWYR system leveraging a contrastive language‐image pre‐training (CLIP) model to achieve zero‐shot classification as well as multi‐modal input encoding, and test the prototype on a large corpus with charts crawled from the Internet.

However, the extent of accessibility design they support for blind and low‐vision people is relatively unknown. It is also unclear how they can improve chart content accessibility beyond conventional alternative text and data tables. To address these issues, we examined the current accessibility features in popular visualization tools, revealing limited support for the standard accessibility methods and scarce support for chart content exploration. Next, we investigate two promising accessibility approaches that provide off‐the‐shelf solutions for chart content accessibility: structured navigation and conversational interaction.

EuroVis,2023,ParaDime: A Framework for Parametric Dimensionality Reduction,10.1111/cgf.14834,"ParaDime is a framework for parametric dimensionality reduction (DR). In parametric DR, neural networks are trained to embed high‐dimensional data items in a low‐dimensional space while minimizing an objective function. ParaDime builds on the idea that the objective functions of several modern DR techniques result from transformed inter‐item relationships. It provides a common interface for specifying these relations and transformations and for defining how they are used within the losses that govern the training process. Through this interface, ParaDime unifies parametric versions of DR techniques such as metric MDS, t‐SNE, and UMAP. It allows users to fully customize all aspects of the DR process. We show how this ease of customization makes ParaDime suitable for experimenting with interesting techniques such as hybrid classification/embedding models and supervised DR. This way, ParaDime opens up new possibilities for visualizing high‐dimensional data.",Andreas P. Hinterreiter; Christina Humer; Bernhard Kainz; Marc Streit,

EuroVis,2023,Illustrative Motion Smoothing for Attention Guidance in Dynamic Visualizations,10.1111/cgf.14836,"3D animations are an effective method to learn about complex dynamic phenomena, such as mesoscale biological processes. The animators' goals are to convey a sense of the scene's overall complexity while, at the same time, visually guiding the user through a story of subsequent events embedded in the chaotic environment. Animators use a variety of visual emphasis techniques to guide the observers' attention through the story, such as highlighting, halos – or by manipulating motion parameters of the scene. In this paper, we investigate the effect of smoothing the motion of contextual scene elements to attract attention to focus elements of the story exhibiting high‐frequency motion. We conducted a crowdsourced study with 108 participants observing short animations with two illustrative motion smoothing strategies: geometric smoothing through noise reduction of contextual motion trajectories and visual smoothing through motion blur of context items. We investigated the observers' ability to follow the story as well as the effect of the techniques on speed perception in a molecular scene. Our results show that moderate motion blur significantly improves users' ability to follow the story. Geometric motion smoothing is less effective but increases the visual appeal of the animation. However, both techniques also slow down the perceived speed of the animation. We discuss the implications of these results and derive design guidelines for animators of complex dynamic visualizations.",Johannes Eschner; Peter Mindek; Manuela Waldner,
EuroVis,2023,Visual Gaze Labeling for Augmented Reality Studies,10.1111/cgf.14837,"Augmented Reality (AR) provides new ways for situated visualization and human‐computer interaction in physical environments. Current evaluation procedures for AR applications rely primarily on questionnaires and interviews, providing qualitative means to assess usability and task solution strategies. Eye tracking extends these existing evaluation methodologies by providing indicators for visual attention to virtual and real elements in the environment. However, the analysis of viewing behavior, especially the comparison of multiple participants, is difficult to achieve in AR. Specifically, the definition of areas of interest (AOIs), which is often a prerequisite for such analysis, is cumbersome and tedious with existing approaches. To address this issue, we present a new visualization approach to define AOIs, label fixations, and investigate the resulting annotated scanpaths. Our approach utilizes automatic annotation of gaze on virtual objects and an image‐based approach that also considers spatial context for the manual annotation of objects in the real world. Our results show, that with our approach, eye tracking data from AR scenes can be annotated and analyzed flexibly with respect to data aspects and annotation strategies.",Seyda Öney; Nelusa Pathmanathan; Michael Becher; Michael Sedlmair; Daniel Weiskopf; Kuno Kurzhals,

The visualization provides insights into how people moved and inspected individual pictures in their spatial context over time.

Existing work has addressed the identification of observable behavioral patterns in state sequences or analysis of isolated internal representations; however, the overall decision‐making of deep‐learning RL agents remains opaque. To tackle this, we present VISITOR, a visual analytics system enabling the analysis of entire state sequences, the diagnosis of singular predictions, and the comparison between agents. A sequence embedding view enables the multiscale analysis of state sequences, utilizing custom embedding techniques for a stable spatialization of the observations and internal states. We provide multiple layers: (1) a state space embedding, highlighting different groups of states inside the state‐action sequences, (2) a trajectory view, emphasizing decision points, (3) a network activation mapping, visualizing the relationship between observations and network activations, (4) a transition embedding, enabling the analysis of state‐to‐state transitions. The embedding view is accompanied by an interactive reward view that captures the temporal development of metrics, which can be linked directly to states in the embedding. Lastly, a model list allows for the quick comparison of models across multiple metrics. Annotations can be exported to communicate results to different audiences. Our two‐stage evaluation with eight experts confirms the effectiveness in identifying states of interest, comparing the quality of policies, and reasoning about the internal decision‐making processes.",Yannick Metz; Eugene Bykovets; Lucas Joos; Daniel A.

EuroVis,2023,LINGO : Visually Debiasing Natural Language Instructions to Support Task Diversity,10.1111/cgf.14840,"Cross‐task generalization is a significant outcome that defines mastery in natural language understanding. Humans show a remarkable aptitude for this, and can solve many different types of tasks, given definitions in the form of textual instructions and a small set of examples. Recent work with pre‐trained language models mimics this learning style: users can define and exemplify a task for the model to attempt as a series of natural language prompts or instructions. While prompting approaches have led to higher cross‐task generalization compared to traditional supervised learning, analyzing ‘bias’ in the task instructions given to the model is a difficult problem, and has thus been relatively unexplored. For instance, are we truly modeling a task, or are we modeling a user's instructions? To help investigate this, we develop LINGO, a novel visual analytics interface that supports an effective, task‐driven workflow to (1) help identify bias in natural language task instructions, (2) alter (or create) task instructions to reduce bias, and (3) evaluate pre‐trained model performance on debiased task instructions. To robustly evaluate LINGO, we conduct a user study with both novice and expert instruction creators, over a dataset of 1,616 linguistic tasks and their natural language instructions, spanning 55 different languages. For both user groups, LINGO promotes the creation of more difficult tasks for pre‐trained models, that contain higher linguistic diversity and lower instruction bias. We additionally discuss how the insights learned in developing and evaluating LINGO can aid in the design of future dashboards that aim to minimize the effort involved in prompt creation across multiple domains.",Anjana Arunkumar; Shubham Sharma; Rakhi Agrawal; Sriram Chandrasekaran; Chris Bryan,

However, the quality of these results has led to existential crises in some fields of art, leading to questions about the role of human agency in the production of meaning in a graphical context. Such issues are central to visualization, and while these generative models have yet to be widely applied in visualization, it seems only a matter of time until their integration is manifest. Seeking to circumvent similar ponderous dilemmas, we attempt to understand the roles that generative models might play across visualization. We do so by constructing a framework that characterizes what these technologies offer at various stages of the visualization workflow, augmented and analyzed through semi‐structured interviews with 21 experts from related domains. Through this work, we map the space of opportunities and risks that might arise in this intersection, identifying doomsday prophecies and delicious low‐hanging fruits that are ripe for research.",Victor Schetinger; Sara Di Bartolomeo; Mennatallah El-Assady; Andrew M.

EuroVis,2023,Visual Analytics on Network Forgetting for Task-Incremental Learning,10.1111/cgf.14842,"Task‐incremental learning (Task‐IL) aims to enable an intelligent agent to continuously accumulate knowledge from new learning tasks without catastrophically forgetting what it has learned in the past. It has drawn increasing attention in recent years, with many algorithms being proposed to mitigate neural network forgetting. However, none of the existing strategies is able to completely eliminate the issues. Moreover, explaining and fully understanding what knowledge and how it is being forgotten during the incremental learning process still remains under‐explored. In this paper, we propose KnowledgeDrift, a visual analytics framework, to interpret the network forgetting with three objectives: (1) to identify when the network fails to memorize the past knowledge, (2) to visualize what information has been forgotten, and (3) to diagnose how knowledge attained in the new model interferes with the one learned in the past. Our analytical framework first identifies the occurrence of forgetting by tracking the task performance under the incremental learning process and then provides in‐depth inspections of drifted information via various levels of data granularity. KnowledgeDrift allows analysts and model developers to enhance their understanding of network forgetting and compare the performance of different incremental learning algorithms. Three case studies are conducted in the paper to further provide insights and guidance for users to effectively diagnose catastrophic forgetting over time.",Ziwei Li; Jiayi Xu 0001; Wei-Lun Chao; Han-Wei Shen,
EuroVis,2022,Of Course it's Political! A Critical Inquiry into Underemphasized Dimensions in Civic Text Visualization,10.1111/cgf.14518,"AbstractRecent developments in critical information visualization have brought the field's attention to political, feminist, ethical, and rhetorical aspects of data visualization. However, less work has explored the interplay between design decisions and political ramifications—structures of authority, means of representation, etc. In this paper, we build upon these critical perspectives and highlight the political aspect of civic text visualization especially in the context of democratic decision‐making. Based on a critical analysis of survey papers about text visualization in general, followed by a review on the status quo of text visualization in civics, we argue that civic text visualization inherits an exclusively analytic framing. This framing leads to a series of issues and challenges in the fundamentally political context of civics, such as misinterpretation of data, missing minority voices, and excluding the public from decision making processes. To span this gap between political context and analytic framing, we provide a series of two‐pole conceptual dimensions, such as from singular user to multiple relationships, and from complexity to inclusivity of visualization design. For each dimension, we discuss how the tensions between these poles can help surface the political ramifications of design decisions in civic text visualization. These dimensions can thus help visualization researchers, designers, and practitioners attend more intentionally to these political aspects and inspire their design choices. We conclude by suggesting that these dimensions may be useful for visualization design across a variety of application domains, beyond civic text visualization.",Eric P. S.

EuroVis,2022,Rich Screen Reader Experiences for Accessible Data Visualization,10.1111/cgf.14519,"AbstractCurrent web accessibility guidelines ask visualization designers to support screen readers via basic non‐visual alternatives like textual descriptions and access to raw data tables. But charts do more than summarize data or reproduce tables; they afford interactive data exploration at varying levels of granularity—from fine‐grained datum‐by‐datum reading to skimming and surfacing high‐level trends. In response to the lack of comparable non‐visual affordances, we present a set of rich screen reader experiences for accessible data visualization and exploration. Through an iterative co‐design process, we identify three key design dimensions for expressive screen reader accessibility: structure, or how chart entities should be organized for a screen reader to traverse; navigation, or the structural, spatial, and targeted operations a user might perform to step through the structure; and, description, or the semantic content, composition, and verbosity of the screen reader's narration. We operationalize these dimensions to prototype screen‐reader‐accessible visualizations that cover a diverse range of chart types and combinations of our design dimensions. We evaluate a subset of these prototypes in a mixed‐methods study with 13 blind and visually impaired readers. Our findings demonstrate that these designs help users conceptualize data spatially, selectively attend to data of interest at different levels of granularity, and experience control and agency over their data analysis process.

This paper presents a novel visual analytics approach for the inspection of infection maps along with their associated metadata, developed collaboratively over 16 months in an evolving emergency response situation. We introduce the concept of representative trees that summarize the many components of a time‐varying infection map while preserving the epidemiological characteristics of each individual transmission tree.

However, the methods used to collect, analyze, and visualize data collected with Likert scales are inconsistent among evaluations in visualization papers. In this paper, we examine the use of Likert scales as a tool for measuring subjective response in a systematic review of 134 visualization evaluations published between 2009 and 2019. We find that papers with both objective and subjective measures do not hold the same reporting and analysis standards for both aspects of their evaluation, producing less rigorous work for the subjective qualities measured by Likert scales. Additionally, we demonstrate that many papers are inconsistent in their interpretations of Likert data as discrete or continuous and may even sacrifice statistical power by applying nonparametric tests unnecessarily. Finally, we identify instances where key details about Likert item construction with the potential to bias participant responses are omitted from evaluation methodology reporting, inhibiting the feasibility and reliability of future replication studies. We summarize recommendations from other fields for best practices with Likert data in visualization evaluations, based on the results of our survey.

EuroVis,2022,How accessible is my visualization? Evaluating visualization accessibility with Chartability,10.1111/cgf.14522,"AbstractNovices and experts have struggled to evaluate the accessibility of data visualizations because there are no common shared guidelines across environments, platforms, and contexts in which data visualizations are authored. Between non‐specific standards bodies like WCAG, emerging research, and guidelines from specific communities of practice, it is hard to organize knowledge on how to evaluate accessible data visualizations. We present Chartability, a set of heuristics synthesized from these various sources which enables designers, developers, researchers, and auditors to evaluate data‐driven visualizations and interfaces for visual, motor, vestibular, neurological, and cognitive accessibility. In this paper, we outline our process of making a set of heuristics and accessibility principles for Chartability and highlight key features in the auditing process. Working with participants on real projects, we found that data practitioners with a novice level of accessibility skills were more confident and found auditing to be easier after using Chartability. Expert accessibility practitioners were eager to integrate Chartability into their own work. Reflecting on Chartability's development and the preliminary user evaluation, we discuss tradeoffs of open projects, working with high‐risk evaluations like auditing projects in the wild, and challenge future research projects at the intersection of visualization and accessibility to consider the broad intersections of disabilities.",Frank Elavsky;Cynthia L.

However, there are no universal design principles that apply to various charts that encode different data types. Towards generalizable principles, we conducted an exploratory experiment to assess how different auditory channels (e.g., pitch, volume) impact the data and visualization perception among people with visual impairments. In our experiment, participants evaluated the intuitiveness and accuracy of the mapping of auditory channels on different data and chart types. We found that participants rated pitch to be the most intuitive, while the number of tappings and the length of sounds yielded the most accurate perception in decoding data. We study how audio channels can intuitively represent different charts and demonstrate that data‐level perception might not directly transfer to chart‐level perception as participants reflect on visual aspects of the charts while listening to audio. We conclude by how future experiments can be designed to establish a robust ranking for creating audio charts.",Ruobin Wang;Crescentia Jung;Yea-Seul Kim,

However, GANs remain notoriously difficult for people to interpret, particularly for modern GANs capable of generating photo‐realistic imagery. In this work we contribute a visual analytics approach for GAN interpretability, where we focus on the analysis and visualization of GAN disentanglement. Disentanglement is concerned with the ability to control content produced by a GAN along a small number of distinct, yet semantic, factors of variation. The goal of our approach is to shed insight on GAN disentanglement, above and beyond coarse summaries, instead permitting a deeper analysis of the data distribution modeled by a GAN. Our visualization allows one to assess a single factor of variation in terms of groupings and trends in the data distribution, where our analysis seeks to relate the learned representation space of GANs with attribute‐based semantic scoring of images produced by GANs. Through use‐cases, we show that our visualization is effective in assessing disentanglement, allowing one to quickly recognize a factor of variation and its overall quality.

Understanding how different models make classification decisions, especially classification disagreements of the same instances, requires a deeper model understanding. We present ModelWise, a visual analytics method to compare multiple multi‐class classifiers in terms of model performance, feature space, and model explanation. ModelWise adapts visualizations with rich interactions to support multiple workflows to achieve model diagnosis, improvement, and selection.

In response, we propose SurfNet, a graph‐based deep learning approach for representing a surface locally at the node level and globally at the surface level. By treating surfaces as graphs, we leverage a graph convolutional network to learn node embedding on a surface. To make the learned embedding effective, we consider various pieces of information (e.g., position, normal, velocity) for network input and investigate multiple losses. Furthermore, we apply dimensionality reduction to transform the learned embeddings into 2D space for understanding and exploration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SurfNet, we evaluate the embeddings in node clustering (node‐level) and surface selection (surface‐level) tasks. We compare SurfNet against state‐of‐the‐art node embedding approaches and surface selection methods. We also demonstrate the superiority of SurfNet by comparing it against a spectral‐based mesh segmentation approach. The results show that SurfNet can learn better representations at the node and surface levels with less training time and fewer training samples while generating comparable or better clustering and selection results.",Jun Han 0010;Chaoli Wang 0001,

These workflows can then be applied to updated datasets, making interactive visualization sessions reusable. We demonstrate this specification using an interactive visualization system that tracks interaction provenance, and allows generating workflows from the recorded actions.

EuroVis,2022,Visual Parameter Selection for Spatial Blind Source Separation,10.1111/cgf.14530,"AbstractAnalysis of spatial multivariate data, i.e., measurements at irregularly‐spaced locations, is a challenging topic in visualization and statistics alike. Such data are inteGral to many domains, e.g., indicators of valuable minerals are measured for mine prospecting. Popular analysis methods, like PCA, often by design do not account for the spatial nature of the data. Thus they, together with their spatial variants, must be employed very carefully. Clearly, it is preferable to use methods that were specifically designed for such data, like spatial blind source separation (SBSS). However, SBSS requires two tuning parameters, which are themselves complex spatial objects. Setting these parameters involves navigating two large and interdependent parameter spaces, while also taking into account prior knowledge of the physical reality represented by the data. To support analysts in this process, we developed a visual analytics prototype. We evaluated it with experts in visualization, SBSS, and geochemistry. Our evaluations show that our interactive prototype allows to define complex and realistic parameter settings efficiently, which was so far impractical. Settings identified by a non‐expert led to remarkable and surprising insights for a domain expert.

In this paper we propose HyperNP, a scalable method that allows for real‐time interactive hyperparameter exploration of projection methods by training neural network approximations. A HyperNP model can be trained on a fraction of the total data instances and hyperparameter configurations that one would like to investigate and can compute projections for new data and hyperparameters at interactive speeds. HyperNP models are compact in size and fast to compute, thus allowing them to be embedded in lightweight visualization systems.

Currently, plant biologists explore the development of an embryo and its hierarchical cell lineage manually, based on a 3D dataset that represents the embryo status at one point in time. This human decision‐making process, however, is time‐consuming, tedious, and error‐prone due to the lack of integrated graphical support for specifying the cell lineage. To fill this gap, we developed a new system to support the biologists in their tasks using an interactive combination of 3D visualization, abstract data visualization, and correctable machine learning to modify the proposed cell lineage. We use existing manually established cell lineages to obtain a neural network model. We then allow biologists to use this model to repeatedly predict assignments of a single cell division stage. After each hierarchy level prediction, we allow them to interactively adjust the machine learning based assignment, which we then integrate into the pool of verified assignments for further predictions. In addition to building the hierarchy this way in a bottom‐up fashion, we also offer users to divide the whole embryo and create the hierarchy tree in a top‐down fashion for a few steps, improving the ML‐based assignments by reducing the potential for wrong predictions. We visualize the continuously updated embryo and its hierarchical development using both 3D spatial and abstract tree representations, together with information about the model's confidence and spatial properties. We conducted case study validations with five expert biologists to explore the utility of our approach and to assess the potential for LineageD to be used in their daily workflow. We found that the visualizations of both 3D representations and abstract representations help with decision making and the hierarchy tree top‐down building approach can reduce assignments errors in real practice.",Jiayi Hong;Alain Trubuil;Tobias Isenberg 0001,
EuroVis,2022,Urban Rhapsody: Large-scale exploration of urban soundscapes,10.1111/cgf.14534,"AbstractNoise is one of the primary quality‐of‐life issues in urban environments. In addition to annoyance, noise negatively impacts public health and educational performance. While low‐cost sensors can be deployed to monitor ambient noise levels at high temporal resolutions, the amount of data they produce and the complexity of these data pose significant analytical challenges. One way to address these challenges is through machine listening techniques, which are used to extract features in attempts to classify the source of noise and understand temporal patterns of a city's noise situation. However, the overwhelming number of noise sources in the urban environment and the scarcity of labeled data makes it nearly impossible to create classification models with large enough vocabularies that capture the true dynamism of urban soundscapes. In this paper, we first identify a set of requirements in the yet unexplored domain of urban soundscape exploration. To satisfy the requirements and tackle the identified challenges, we propose Urban Rhapsody, a framework that combines state‐of‐the‐art audio representation, machine learning and visual analytics to allow users to interactively create classification models, understand noise patterns of a city, and quickly retrieve and label audio excerpts in order to create a large high‐precision annotated database of urban sound recordings. We demonstrate the tool's utility through case studies performed by domain experts using data generated over the five‐year deployment of a one‐of‐a‐kind sensor network in New York City.",João Rulff;Fabio Miranda 0001;Maryam Hosseini;Marcos Lage;Mark Cartwright;Graham Dove;Juan Pablo Bello;Cláudio T.

EuroVis,2022,AirLens: Multi-Level Visual Exploration of Air Quality Evolution in Urban Agglomerations,10.1111/cgf.14535,"AbstractThe precise prevention and control of air pollution is a great challenge faced by environmental experts in recent years. Understanding the air quality evolution in the urban agglomeration is important for coordinated control of air pollution. However, the complex pollutant interactions between different cities lead to the collaborative evolution of air quality. The existing statistical and machine learning methods cannot well support the comprehensive analysis of the dynamic air quality evolution. In this study, we propose AirLens, an interactive visual analytics system that can help domain experts explore and understand the air quality evolution in the urban agglomeration from multiple levels and multiple aspects. To facilitate the cognition of the complex multivariate spatiotemporal data, we first propose a multi‐run clustering strategy with a novel glyph design for summarizing and understanding the typical pollutant patterns effectively. On this basis, the system supports the multi‐level exploration of air quality evolution, namely, the overall level, stage level and detail level. Frequent pattern mining, city community extraction and useful filters are integrated into the system for discovering significant information comprehensively. The case study and positive feedback from domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of AirLens.",Dezhan Qu;Cheng Lv;Yiming Lin;Huijie Zhang;Rong Wang,
EuroVis,2022,Where did my Lines go? Visualizing Missing Data in Parallel Coordinates,10.1111/cgf.14536,"AbstractWe evaluate visualization concepts to represent missing values in parallel coordinates. We focus on the trade‐off between the ability to perceive missing values and the concept's impact on common tasks. For this purpose, we identified three missing value representation concepts: removing line segments where values are missing, adding a separate, horizontal axis onto which missing values are projected, and using imputed values as a replacement for missing values. For the missing values axis and imputed values concepts, we additionally add downplay and highlight variations. We performed a crowd‐sourced, quantitative user study with 732 participants comparing the concepts and their variations using five real‐world datasets.

EuroVis,2022,Optimizing Grid Layouts for Level-of-Detail Exploration of Large Data Collections,10.1111/cgf.14537,"AbstractThis paper introduces an optimization approach for generating grid layouts from large data collections such that they are amenable to level‐of‐detail presentation and exploration. Classic (flat) grid layouts visually do not scale to large collections, yielding overwhelming numbers of tiny member representations. The proposed local search‐based progressive optimization scheme generates hierarchical grids: leaves correspond to one grid cell and represent one member, while inner nodes cover a quadratic range of cells and convey an aggregate of contained members. The scheme is solely based on pairwise distances and jointly optimizes for homogeneity within inner nodes and across grid neighbors. The generated grids allow to present and flexibly explore the whole data collection with arbitrary local granularity. Diverse use cases featuring large data collections exemplify the application: stock market predictions from a Black‐Scholes model, channel structures in soil from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and image collections with feature vectors from neural network classification models. The paper presents feedback by a domain scientist, compares against previous approaches, and demonstrates visual and computational scalability to a million members, surpassing classic grid layout techniques by orders of magnitude.",Steffen Frey,
EuroVis,2022,Six methods for transforming layered hypergraphs to apply layered graph layout algorithms,10.1111/cgf.14538,"AbstractHypergraphs are a generalization of graphs in which edges (hyperedges) can connect more than two vertices—as opposed to ordinary graphs where edges involve only two vertices. Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real‐life use cases.

EuroVis,2022,Exploring Multivariate Event Sequences with an Interactive Similarity Builder,10.1111/cgf.14539,"AbstractSimilarity‐based exploration is an effective method in knowledge discovery. Faced with multivariate event sequence data (MVES), developing a satisfactory similarity measurement for a specific question is challenging because of the heterogeneity introduced by numerous attributes with different data formats, coupled with their associations. Additionally, the absence of effective validation feedback makes judging the goodness of a measurement scheme a time‐consuming and error‐prone procedure. To free analysts from tedious programming to concentrate on the exploration of MVES data, this paper introduces an interactive similarity builder, where analysts can use visual building blocks for assembling similarity measurements in a drag‐and‐drop and incremental fashion. Based on the builder, we further propose a visual analytics framework that provides multi‐granularity visual validations for measurement schemes and supports a recursive workflow for refining the focus set. We illustrate the power of our prototype through a case study and a user study with real‐world datasets. Results suggest that the system improves the efficiency of developing similarity measurements and the usefulness of exploring MVES data.",Shaobin Xu;Minghui Sun;Zhengtai Zhang;Hao Xue,

Our proposed visual analytics dashboard provides access to computational methods, generating varying perspectives on the same data. The proposed application uses metadata including composers, type, epoch, and low‐level features, such as pitch, melody, and rhythm. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a pair‐analytics study with nine participants. The qualitative results show that CorpusVis supports users in performing exploratory and confirmatory analysis, leading them to new insights and findings.

EuroVis,2022,LMFingerprints: Visual Explanations of Language Model Embedding Spaces through Layerwise Contextualization Scores,10.1111/cgf.14541,"AbstractLanguage models, such as BERT, construct multiple, contextualized embeddings for each word occurrence in a corpus. Understanding how the contextualization propagates through the model's layers is crucial for deciding which layers to use for a specific analysis task. Currently, most embedding spaces are explained by probing classifiers; however, some findings remain inconclusive. In this paper, we present LMFingerprints, a novel scoring‐based technique for the explanation of contextualized word embeddings. We introduce two categories of scoring functions, which measure (1) the degree of contextualization, i.e., the layerwise changes in the embedding vectors, and (2) the type of contextualization, i.e., the captured context information. We integrate these scores into an interactive explanation workspace. By combining visual and verbal elements, we provide an overview of contextualization in six popular transformer‐based language models. We evaluate hypotheses from the domain of computational linguistics, and our results not only confirm findings from related work but also reveal new aspects about the information captured in the embedding spaces. For instance, we show that while numbers are poorly contextualized, stopwords have an unexpected high contextualization in the models' upper layers, where their neighborhoods shift from similar functionality tokens to tokens that contribute to the meaning of the surrounding sentences.",Rita Sevastjanova;Aikaterini-Lida Kalouli;Christin Beck;Hanna Hauptmann;Mennatallah El-Assady,
EuroVis,2022,Streaming Approach to In Situ Selection of Key Time Steps for Time-Varying Volume Data,10.1111/cgf.14542,"AbstractKey time steps selection, i.e., selecting a subset of most representative time steps, is essential for effective and efficient scientific visualization of large time‐varying volume data. In particular, as computer simulations continue to grow in size and complexity, they often generate output that exceeds both the available storage capacity and bandwidth for transferring results to storage, making it indispensable to save only a subset of time steps. At the same time, this subset must be chosen so that it is highly representative, to facilitate post‐processing and reconstruction with high fidelity. The key time steps selection problem is especially challenging in the in situ setting, where we can only process data in one pass in an online streaming fashion, using a small amount of main memory and fast computation. In this paper, we formulate the problem as that of optimal piece‐wise linear interpolation. We first apply a method from numerical linear algebra to compute linear interpolation solutions and their errors in an online streaming fashion. Using that method as a building block, we can obtain a global optimal solution for the piece‐wise linear interpolation problem via a standard dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. However, this approach needs to process the time steps in multiple passes and is too slow for the in situ setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approximation algorithm, which processes time steps in one pass in an online streaming fashion, with very efficient computing time and main memory space both in theory and in practice. The algorithm is suitable for the in situ setting. Moreover, we prove that our algorithm, which is based on a greedy update rule, has strong theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality and the number of time steps stored. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm suitable for in situ key time steps selection with such theoretical guarantees, and is the main contribution of this paper. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our new techniques.",Mengxi Wu;Yi-Jen Chiang;Christopher Musco,
EuroVis,2022,An Interactive Approach for Identifying Structure Definitions,10.1111/cgf.14543,"AbstractOur ability to grasp and understand complex phenomena is essentially based on recognizing structures and relating these to each other. For example, any meteorological description of a weather condition and explanation of its evolution recurs to meteorological structures, such as convection and circulation structures, cloud fields and rain fronts. All of these are spatiotemporal structures, defined by time‐dependent patterns in the underlying fields. Typically, such a structure is defined by a verbal description that corresponds to the more or less uniform, often somewhat vague mental images of the experts. However, a precise, formal definition of the structures or, more generally, of the concepts is often desirable, e.g., to enable automated data analysis or the development of phenomenological models. Here, we present a systematic approach and an interactive tool to obtain formal definitions of spatiotemporal structures. The tool enables experts to evaluate and compare different structure definitions on the basis of data sets with time‐dependent fields that contain the respective structure. Since structure definitions are typically parameterized, an essential part is to identify parameter ranges that lead to desired structures in all time steps. In addition, it is important to allow a quantitative assessment of the resulting structures simultaneously. We demonstrate the use of the tool by applying it to two meteorological examples: finding structure definitions for vortex cores and center lines of temporarily evolving tropical cyclones.Ideally, structure definitions should be objective and applicable to as many data sets as possible. However, finding such definitions, e.g., for the common atmospheric structures in meteorology, can only be a long‐term goal. The proposed procedure, together with the presented tool, is just a first systematic approach aiming at facilitating this long and arduous way.",Natalia Mikula;Tom Dörffel;Daniel Baum;Hans-Christian Hege,
EuroVis,2022,Level of Detail Exploration of Electronic Transition Ensembles using Hierarchical Clustering,10.1111/cgf.14544,"AbstractWe present a pipeline for the interactive visual analysis and exploration of molecular electronic transition ensembles. Each ensemble member is specified by a molecular configuration, the charge transfer between two molecular states, and a set of physical properties. The pipeline is targeted towards theoretical chemists, supporting them in comparing and characterizing electronic transitions by combining automatic and interactive visual analysis. A quantitative feature vector characterizing the electron charge transfer serves as the basis for hierarchical clustering as well as for the visual representations. The interface for the visual exploration consists of four components. A dendrogram provides an overview of the ensemble. It is augmented with a level of detail glyph for each cluster. A scatterplot using dimensionality reduction provides a second visualization, highlighting ensemble outliers. Parallel coordinates show the correlation with physical parameters. A spatial representation of selected ensemble members supports an in‐depth inspection of transitions in a form that is familiar to chemists. All views are linked and can be used to filter and select ensemble members. The usefulness of the pipeline is shown in three different case studies.",Signe Sidwall Thygesen;Talha Bin Masood;Mathieu Linares;Vijay Natarajan;Ingrid Hotz,
EuroVis,2022,A Flip-book of Knot Diagrams for Visualizing Surfaces in 4-Space,10.1111/cgf.14545,"AbstractJust as 2D shadows of 3D curves lose structure where lines cross, 3D graphics projections of smooth 4D topological surfaces are interrupted where one surface intersects itself. They twist, turn, and fold back on themselves, leaving important but hidden features behind the surface sheets. In this paper, we propose a smart slicing tool that can read the 4D surface in its entropy map and suggest the optimal way to generate cross‐sectional images — or “slices” — of the surface to visualize its underlying 4D structure. Our visualization thinks of a 4D‐embedded surface as a collection of 3D curves stacked in time, very much like a flip‐book animation, where successive terms in the sequence differ at most by a critical change. This novel method can generate topologically meaningful visualization to depict complex and unfamiliar 4D surfaces, with the minimum number of cross‐sectional diagrams. Our approach has been successfully used to create flip‐books of diagrams to visualize a range of known 4D surfaces. In this preliminary study, our results show that the new visualization and slicing tool can help the viewers to understand and describe the complex spatial relationships and overall structures of 4D surfaces.",Huan Liu;Hui Zhang,
EuroVis,2022,LOOPS: LOcally Optimized Polygon Simplification,10.1111/cgf.14546,"AbstractDisplaying polygonal vector data is essential in various application scenarios such as geometry visualization, vector graphics rendering, CAD drawing and in particular geographic, or cartographic visualization. Dealing with static polygonal datasets that has a large scale and are highly detailed poses several challenges to the efficient and adaptive display of polygons in interactive geographic visualization applications. For linear vector data, only recently a GPU‐based level‐of‐detail (LOD) polyline simplification and rendering approach has been presented which can perform locally‐adaptive LOD visualization of large‐scale line datasets interactively. However, locally optimized LOD simplification and interactive display of large‐scale polygon data, consisting of filled vector line loops, remains still a challenge, specifically in 3D geographic visualizations where varying LOD over a scene is necessary. Our solution to this challenge is a novel technique for locally‐optimized simplification and visualization of 2D polygons over a 3D terrain which features a parallelized point‐inside‐polygon testing mechanism. Our approach is capable of employing any simplification algorithm that sequentially removes vertices such as Douglas‐Peucker and Wang‐Müller. Moreover, we generalized our technique to also visualizing polylines in order to have a unified method for displaying both data types. The results and performance analysis show that our new algorithm can handle large datasets containing polygons composed of millions of segments in real time, and has a lower memory demand and higher performance in comparison to prior methods of line simplification and visualization.",Alireza Amiraghdam;Alexandra Diehl;Renato Pajarola,
EuroVis,2022,Branch Decomposition-Independent Edit Distances for Merge Trees,10.1111/cgf.14547,"AbstractEdit distances between merge trees of scalar fields have many applications in scientific visualization, such as ensemble analysis, feature tracking or symmetry detection. In this paper, we propose branch mappings, a novel approach to the construction of edit mappings for merge trees. Classic edit mappings match nodes or edges of two trees onto each other, and therefore have to either rely on branch decompositions of both trees or have to use auxiliary node properties to determine a matching. In contrast, branch mappings employ branch properties instead of node similarity information, and are independent of predetermined branch decompositions. Especially for topological features, which are typically based on branch properties, this allows a more intuitive distance measure which is also less susceptible to instabilities from small‐scale perturbations. For trees with 𝒪(n) nodes, we describe an 𝒪(n4) algorithm for computing optimal branch mappings, which is faster than the only other branch decomposition‐independent method in the literature by more than a linear factor. Furthermore, we compare the results of our method on synthetic and real‐world examples to demonstrate its practicality and utility.",Florian Wetzels;Heike Leitte;Christoph Garth,
EuroVis,2022,SimilarityNet: A Deep Neural Network for Similarity Analysis Within Spatio-temporal Ensembles,10.1111/cgf.14548,"AbstractLatent feature spaces of deep neural networks are frequently used to effectively capture semantic characteristics of a given dataset. In the context of spatio‐temporal ensemble data, the latent space represents a similarity space without the need of an explicit definition of a field similarity measure. Commonly, these networks are trained for specific data within a targeted application. We instead propose a general training strategy in conjunction with a deep neural network architecture, which is readily applicable to any spatio‐temporal ensemble data without re‐training. The latent‐space visualization allows for a comprehensive visual analysis of patterns and temporal evolution within the ensemble. With the use of SimilarityNet, we are able to perform similarity analyses on large‐scale spatio‐temporal ensembles in less than a second on commodity consumer hardware. We qualitatively compare our results to visualizations with established field similarity measures to document the interpretability of our latent space visualizations and show that they are feasible for an in‐depth basic understanding of the underlying temporal evolution of a given ensemble.",Karim Huesmann;Lars Linsen,
EuroVis,2022,Neural Flow Map Reconstruction,10.1111/cgf.14549,"AbstractIn this paper we present a reconstruction technique for the reduction of unsteady flow data based on neural representations of time‐varying vector fields. Our approach is motivated by the large amount of data typically generated in numerical simulations, and in turn the types of data that domain scientists can generate in situ that are compact, yet useful, for post hoc analysis. One type of data commonly acquired during simulation are samples of the flow map, where a single sample is the result of integrating the underlying vector field for a specified time duration. In our work, we treat a collection of flow map samples for a single dataset as a meaningful, compact, and yet incomplete, representation of unsteady flow, and our central objective is to find a representation that enables us to best recover arbitrary flow map samples. To this end, we introduce a technique for learning implicit neural representations of time‐varying vector fields that are specifically optimized to reproduce flow map samples sparsely covering the spatiotemporal domain of the data. We show that, despite aggressive data reduction, our optimization problem — learning a function‐space neural network to reproduce flow map samples under a fixed integration scheme — leads to representations that demonstrate strong generalization, both in the field itself, and using the field to approximate the flow map. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis across different datasets we show that our approach is an improvement across a variety of data reduction methods, and across a variety of measures ranging from improved vector fields, flow maps, and features derived from the flow map.",Saroj Sahoo;Y.

We are primarily interested in the exploration of 3D unstructured datasets such as cloud points or volumetric datasets. AR‐HMDs immerse users by showing datasets stereoscopically, and tablets provide a set of 2D exploration tools. Because AR‐HMDs merge the visualization, interaction, and the users' physical spaces, users can also use the tablets as tangible objects in their 3D space. Nonetheless, the tablets' touch displays provide their own visualization and interaction spaces, separated from those of the AR‐HMD. This raises several research questions compared to traditional setups. In this paper, we theorize, discuss, and study different available mappings for manual spatial selections using a tangible tablet within an AR‐HMD space. We then study the use of this tablet within a 3D AR environment, compared to its use with a 2D external screen.",Mickaël Sereno;Stéphane Gosset;Lonni Besançon;Tobias Isenberg 0001,

The combination of touch, pen, and speech interaction with mobile devices is considered particularly promising for a more natural experience. However, we do not yet know how everyday work with multimodal data visualizations on a mobile device differs from working in the standard WIMP workplace setup. To address this gap, we created a visualization system for social scientists, with a WIMP interface for desktop PCs, and a multimodal interface for tablets. The system provides visualizations to explore spatio‐temporal data with consistent WIMP and multimodal interaction techniques. To investigate how the different combinations of devices and interaction modalities affect the performance and experience of domain experts in a work setting, we conducted an experiment with 16 social scientists where they carried out a series of tasks with both interfaces. Participants were significantly faster and slightly more accurate on the WIMP interface. They solved the tasks with different strategies according to the interaction modalities available. The pen was the most used and appreciated input modality. Most participants preferred the multimodal setup and could imagine using it at work.

Results contribute to advancing the understanding of how visualizations can evoke emotions and their impact on prosocial behaviors, such as helping people in need. Recent literature examined the effect of different on‐screen data representations on emotion or prosociality, but little has been done concerning visualizations shown in a public place — especially a space contextually relevant to the data — or presented through unconventional media formats such as physical marks. We conducted two in‐the‐wild studies to investigate how different factors affect people's self‐reported compassion and intention to donate. We compared three ways of presenting data about the harassment cases: (1) communicating data only verbally; (2) using a printed poster with aggregated information; and (3) using a physicalization with detailed information about each story. We found that the physicalization influenced people to donate more than only hearing about the data, but it is unclear if the same applied to the poster visualization. Also, passers‐by reported a likely small increase in compassion when they saw the physicalization instead of the poster. We also examined the role of situatedness by showing the physicalization in a site that is not contextually relevant to the data. Our results suggest that people had a similar intention to donate and levels of compassion in both places. Those findings may indicate that using specific visualization designs to support campaigns about sensitive causes (e.g., sexual harassment) can increase the emotional response of passers‐by and may motivate them to help, independently of where the data representation is shown. Finally, this work also informs on the strengths and weaknesses of using research in the wild to evaluate data visualizations in public spaces.",Luiz Morais;Nazareno Andrade;D. Sousa,

Operators of safety‐critical systems learn to make decisions effectively throughout extensive training programs and many years of experience. In the domain of air traffic control, expensive training with high dropout rates calls for research to enhance novices' ability to detect and resolve conflicts in the airspace. While previous researchers have mostly focused on redesigning training instructions and programs, the current paper explores possible benefits of novel visual representations to improve novices' understanding of the situations as well as their decision‐making process. We conduct an experimental evaluation study testing two ecological visual analytics interfaces, developed in a previous study, as support systems to facilitate novice decision‐making. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we describe the application of an ecological interface design approach to the development of two visual analytics interfaces. Second, we perform a human‐in‐the‐loop experiment with forty‐five novices within a simplified air traffic control simulation environment. Third, by performing an expert‐novice comparison we investigate the extent to which effects of the proposed interfaces can be attributed to the subjects' expertise. The results show that the proposed ecological visual analytics interfaces improved novices' understanding of the information about conflicts as well as their problem‐solving performance. Further, the results show that the beneficial effects of the proposed interfaces were more attributable to the visual representations than the users' expertise.",Elmira Zohrevandi;Carl A. L.

EuroVis,2022,A Typology of Guidance Tasks in Mixed-Initiative Visual Analytics Environments,10.1111/cgf.14555,"AbstractGuidance has been proposed as a conceptual framework to understand how mixed‐initiative visual analytics approaches can actively support users as they solve analytical tasks. While user tasks received a fair share of attention, it is still not completely clear how they could be supported with guidance and how such support could influence the progress of the task itself. Our observation is that there is a research gap in understanding the effect of guidance on the analytical discourse, in particular, for the knowledge generation in mixed‐initiative approaches. As a consequence, guidance in a visual analytics environment is usually indistinguishable from common visualization features, making user responses challenging to predict and measure. To address these issues, we take a system perspective to propose the notion of guidance tasks and we present it as a typology closely aligned to established user task typologies. We derived the proposed typology directly from a model of guidance in the knowledge generation process and illustrate its implications for guidance design. By discussing three case studies, we show how our typology can be applied to analyze existing guidance systems. We argue that without a clear consideration of the system perspective, the analysis of tasks in mixed‐initiative approaches is incomplete. Finally, by analyzing matchings of user and guidance tasks, we describe how guidance tasks could either help the user conclude the analysis or change its course.",Ignacio Pérez-Messina;Davide Ceneda;Mennatallah El-Assady;Silvia Miksch;Fabian Sperrle,

Effectively eliciting those beliefs has potential for high impact across a broad set of applications, including increased engagement with data and visualizations, personalizing visualizations, and understanding users' visual reasoning processes, which can inform improved data analysis and decision making strategies (e.g., via bias mitigation). Recently, belief‐driven visualizations have been used to elicit and visualize readers' beliefs in a visualization alongside data in narrative media and data journalism platforms such as the New York Times and FiveThirtyEight. However, there is little research on different aspects that constitute designing an effective belief‐driven visualization. In this paper, we synthesize a design space for belief‐driven visualizations based on formative and summative interviews with designers and visualization experts. The design space includes 7 main design considerations, beginning with an assumed data set, then structured according to: from who, why, when, what, and how the belief is elicited, and the possible feedback about the belief that may be provided to the visualization viewer. The design space covers considerations such as the type of data parameter with optional uncertainty being elicited, interaction techniques, and visual feedback, among others.

However, when it is done poorly or maliciously, a visualization may become misleading or even deceiving. Visualizations give further strength to the dissemination of misinformation on the Internet. The visualization research community has long been aware of visualizations that misinform the audience, mostly associated with the terms “lie” and “deceptive.” Still, these discussions have focused only on a handful of cases. To better understand the landscape of misleading visualizations, we open‐coded over one thousand real‐world visualizations that have been reported as misleading. From these examples, we discovered 74 types of issues and formed a taxonomy of misleading elements in visualizations. We found four directions that the research community can follow to widen the discussion on misleading visualizations: (1) informal fallacies in visualizations, (2) exploiting conventions and data literacy, (3) deceptive tricks in uncommon charts, and (4) understanding the designers' dilemma.

EuroVis,2022,A Survey of Visualization and Analysis in High-Resolution Connectomics,10.1111/cgf.14574,"AbstractThe field of connectomics aims to reconstruct the wiring diagram of Neurons and synapses to enable new insights into the workings of the brain. Reconstructing and analyzing the Neuronal connectivity, however, relies on many individual steps, starting from high‐resolution data acquisition to automated segmentation, proofreading, interactive data exploration, and circuit analysis. All of these steps have to handle large and complex datasets and rely on or benefit from integrated visualization methods. In this state‐of‐the‐art report, we describe visualization methods that can be applied throughout the connectomics pipeline, from data acquisition to circuit analysis. We first define the different steps of the pipeline and focus on how visualization is currently integrated into these steps. We also survey open science initiatives in connectomics, including usable open‐source tools and publicly available datasets. Finally, we discuss open challenges and possible future directions of this exciting research field.",Johanna Beyer;Jakob Troidl;Saeed Boorboor;Markus Hadwiger;Arie E. Kaufman;Hanspeter Pfister,
EuroVis,2022,A Grammar-Based Approach for Applying Visualization Taxonomies to Interaction Logs,10.1111/cgf.14557,"AbstractResearchers collect large amounts of user interaction data with the goal of mapping user's workflows and behaviors to their high‐level motivations, intuitions, and goals. Although the visual analytics community has proposed numerous taxonomies to facilitate this mapping process, no formal methods exist for systematically applying these existing theories to user interaction logs. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between visualization task taxonomies and interaction log data by making the taxonomies more actionable for interaction log analysis. To achieve this, we leverage structural parallels between how people express themselves through interactions and language by reformulating existing theories as regular grammars. We represent interactions as terminals within a regular grammar, similar to the role of individual words in a language, and patterns of interactions or non‐terminals as regular expressions over these terminals to capture common language patterns. To demonstrate our approach, we generate regular grammars for seven existing visualization taxonomies and develop code to apply them to three public interaction log datasets. In analyzing these regular grammars, we find that the taxonomies at the low‐level (i.e., terminals) show mixed results in expressing multiple interaction log datasets, and taxonomies at the high‐level (i.e., regular expressions) have limited expressiveness, due to primarily two challenges: inconsistencies in interaction log dataset granularity and structure, and under‐expressiveness of certain terminals. Based on our findings, we suggest new research directions for the visualization community to augment existing taxonomies, develop new ones, and build better interaction log recording processes to facilitate the data‐driven development of user behavior taxonomies.",Sneha Gathani;Shayan Monadjemi;Alvitta Ottley;Leilani Battle,
EuroVis,2022,A Process Model for Dashboard Onboarding,10.1111/cgf.14558,"AbstractDashboards are used ubiquitously to gain and present insights into data by means of interactive visualizations. To bridge the gap between non‐expert dashboard users and potentially complex datasets and/or visualizations, a variety of onboarding strategies are employed, including videos, narration, and interactive tutorials. We propose a process model for dashboard onboarding that formalizes and unifies such diverse onboarding strategies. Our model introduces the onboarding loop alongside the dashboard usage loop. Unpacking the onboarding loop reveals how each onboarding strategy combines selected building blocks of the dashboard with an onboarding narrative. Specific means are applied to this narration sequence for onboarding, which results in onboarding artifacts that are presented to the user via an interface. We concretize these concepts by showing how our process model can be used to describe a selection of real‐world onboarding examples. Finally, we discuss how our model can serve as an actionable blueprint for developing new onboarding systems.",Vaishali Dhanoa;Conny Walchshofer;Andreas P. Hinterreiter;Holger Stitz;M.

Physicalizations are an important component of anatomical and biological education and edutainment. However, existing approaches have mainly revolved around creating data sculptures through digital fabrication. Only a few recent works proposed computer‐aided pipelines for generating sculptures, such as papercrafts, with affordable and readily available materials. Papercraft generation remains a Challenging topic by itself. Yet, anatomical and biological applications pose additional Challenges, such as reconstruction complexity and insufficiency to account for multiple, Nested structures—often present in anatomical and biological structures. Our workflow comprises the following steps: (i) define the Nested configuration of the model and detect its levels, (ii) calculate the viewpoint that provides optimal, unobstructed views on inner levels, (iii) perform cuts on the outer levels to reveal the inner ones based on the viewpoint selection, (iv) estimate the stability of the cut papercraft to ensure a reliable outcome, (v) generate textures at each level, as a smart visibility mechanism that provides additional information on the inner structures, and (vi) unfold each textured mesh guaranteeing reconstruction.

EuroVis,2022,Vessel Maps: A Survey of Map-Like Visualizations of the Cardiovascular System,10.1111/cgf.14576,"AbstractMap‐like visualizations of patient‐specific cardiovascular structures have been applied in numerous medical application contexts. The term map‐like alludes to the characteristics these depictions share with cartographic maps: they show the spatial relations of data attributes from a single perspective, they abstract the underlying data to inCrease legibility, and they facilitate tasks centered around overview, navigation, and comparison. A vast landscape of techniques exists to derive such maps from heterogeneous data spaces. Yet, they all target similar purposes within disease diagnostics, treatment, or research and they face coinciding challenges in mapping the spatial component of a treelike structure to a legible layout. In this report, we present a framing to unify these approaches. On the one hand, we provide a classification of the existing literature according to the data spaces such maps can be derived from. On the other hand, we view the approaches in light of the manifold requirements medical practitioners and researchers have in their efforts to combat the ever‐growing burden of cardiovascular disease. Based on these two perspectives, we offer recommendations for the design of map‐like visualizations of the cardiovascular system.",Pepe Eulzer;Monique Meuschke;Gabriel Mistelbauer;Kai Lawonn,
EuroVis,2021,VEHICLE: Validation and Exploration of the Hierarchical Integration of Conflict Event Data,10.1111/cgf.14284,"AbstractThe exploration of large‐scale conflicts, as well as their causes and effects, is an important aspect of socio‐political analysis. Since event data related to major conflicts are usually obtained from different sources, researchers developed a semi‐automatic matching algorithm to integrate event data of different origins into one comprehensive dataset using hierarchical taxonomies. The validity of the corresponding integration results is not easy to assess since the results depend on user‐defined input parameters and the relationships between the original data sources. However, only rudimentary visualization techniques have been used so far to analyze the results, allowing no trustworthy validation or exploration of how the final dataset is composed. To overcome this problem, we developed VEHICLE, a web‐based tool to validate and explore the results of the hierarchical integration. For the design, we collaborated with a domain expert to identify the underlying domain problems and derive a task and workflow description. The tool combines both traditional and novel visual analysis techniques, employing statistical and map‐based depictions as well as advanced interaction techniques. We showed the usefulness of VEHICLE in two case studies and by conducting an evaluation together with conflict researchers, confirming domain hypotheses and generating new insights.",Benedikt Mayer;Kai Lawonn;Karsten Donnay;Bernhard Preim;Monique Meuschke,
EuroVis,2021,Topography of Violence: Considerations for Ethical and Collaborative Visualization Design,10.1111/cgf.14285,"AbstractBased on a collaborative visualization design process involving sensitive historical data and historiographical expertise, we investigate the relevance of ethical principles in visualization design. While fundamental ethical norms like truthfulness and accuracy are already well‐described and common goals in visualization design, datasets that are accompanied by specific ethical concerns need to be processed and visualized with an additional level of carefulness and thought. There has been little research on adequate visualization design incorporating such considerations. To address this gap we present insights from Topography of Violence, a visualization project with the Jewish Museum Berlin that focuses on a dataset of more than 4,500 acts of violence against Jews in Germany between 1930 and 1938. Drawing from the joint project, we develop an approach to the visualization of sensitive data, which features both conceptual and procedural considerations for visualization design.

EuroVis,2021,CommAID: Visual Analytics for Communication Analysis through Interactive Dynamics Modeling,10.1111/cgf.14286,"AbstractCommunication consists of both meta‐information as well as content. Currently, the automated analysis of such data often focuses either on the network aspects via social network analysis or on the content, utilizing methods from text‐mining. However, the first category of approaches does not leverage the rich content information, while the latter ignores the conversation environment and the temporal evolution, as evident in the meta‐information. In contradiction to communication research, which stresses the importance of a holistic approach, both aspects are rarely applied simultaneously, and consequently, their combination has not yet received enough attention in automated analysis systems. In this work, we aim to address this challenge by discussing the difficulties and design decisions of such a path as well as contribute CommAID, a blueprint for a holistic strategy to communication analysis. It features an integrated visual analytics design to analyze communication networks through dynamics modeling, semantic pattern retrieval, and a user‐adaptable and problem‐specific machine learning‐based retrieval system. An interactive multi‐level matrix‐based visualization facilitates a focused analysis of both network and content using inline visuals supporting cross‐checks and reducing context switches. We evaluate our approach in both a case study and through formative evaluation with eight law enforcement experts using a real‐world communication corpus. Results show that our solution surpasses existing techniques in terms of integration level and applicability.

EuroVis,2021,ProBGP: Progressive Visual Analytics of Live BGP Updates,10.1111/cgf.14287,"AbstractThe global routing network is the backbone of the Internet. However, it is quite vulnerable to attacks that cause major disruptions or routing manipulations. Prior related works have visualized routing path changes with node link diagrams, but it requires strong domain expertise to understand if a routing change between autonomous systems is suspicious. Geographic visualization has an advantage over conventional node‐link diagrams by helping uncover such suspicious routes as the user can immediately see if a path is the shortest path to the target or an unreasonable detour. In this paper, we present ProBGP, a web‐based progressive approach to visually analyze BGP update routes. We created a novel progressive data processing algorithm for the geographic approximation of autonomous systems and combined it with a progressively updating visualization. While the newest log data is continuously loaded, our approach also allows querying the entire log recordings since 1999. We present the usefulness of our approach with a real use case of a major route leak from June 2019. We report on multiple interviews with domain experts throughout the development.

EuroVis,2021,Color Nameability Predicts Inference Accuracy in Spatial Visualizations,10.1111/cgf.14288,"AbstractColor encoding is foundational to visualizing quantitative data. Guidelines for colormap design have traditionally emphasized perceptual principles, such as order and uniformity. However, colors also evoke cognitive and linguistic associations whose role in data interpretation remains underexplored. We study how two linguistic factors, name salience and name variation, affect people's ability to draw inferences from spatial visualizations. In two experiments, we found that participants are better at interpreting visualizations when viewing colors with more salient names (e.g., prototypical ‘blue’, ‘yellow’, and ‘red’ over ‘teal’, ‘beige’, and ‘maroon’). The effect was robust across four visualization types, but was more pronounced in continuous (e.g., smooth geographical maps) than in similar discrete representations (e.g., choropleths). Participants' accuracy also improved as the number of nameable colors increased, although the latter had a less robust effect. Our findings suggest that color nameability is an important design consideration for quantitative colormaps, and may even outweigh traditional perceptual metrics. In particular, we found that the linguistic associations of color are a better predictor of performance than the perceptual properties of those colors. We discuss the implications and outline research opportunities. The data and materials for this study are available at https://osf.io/asb7n",Khairi Reda;Amey A. Salvi;Jack Gray;Michael E. Papka,
EuroVis,2021,What are Table Cartograms Good for Anyway? An Algebraic Analysis,10.1111/cgf.14289,"AbstractUnfamiliar or esoteric visual forms arise in many areas of visualization. While such forms can be intriguing, it can be unclear how to make effective use of them without long periods of practice or costly user studies. In this work we analyze the table cartogram—a graphic which visualizes tabular data by bringing the areas of a grid of quadrilaterals into correspondence with the input data, like a heat map that has been “area‐ed” rather than colored. Despite having existed for several years, little is known about its appropriate usage. We mend this gap by using Algebraic Visualization Design to show that they are best suited to relatively small tables with ordinal axes for some comparison and outlier identification tasks. In doing so we demonstrate a discount theory‐based analysis that can be used to cheaply determine best practices for unknown visualizations.",Andrew M. McNutt,
EuroVis,2021,Exploring Multi-dimensional Data via Subset Embedding,10.1111/cgf.14290,"AbstractMulti‐dimensional data exploration is a classic research topic in visualization. Most existing approaches are designed for identifying record patterns in dimensional space or subspace. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to exploring subset patterns. The core of the approach is a subset embedding network (SEN) that represents a group of subsets as uniformly‐formatted embeddings. We implement the SEN as multiple subnets with separate loss functions. The design enables to handle arbitrary subsets and capture the similarity of subsets on single features, thus achieving accurate pattern exploration, which in most cases is searching for subsets having similar values on few features. Moreover, each subnet is a fully‐connected neural network with one hidden layer. The simple structure brings high training efficiency. We integrate the SEN into a visualization system that achieves a 3‐step workflow. Specifically, analysts (1) partition the given dataset into subsets, (2) select portions in a projected latent space created using the SEN, and (3) determine the existence of patterns within selected subsets. Generally, the system combines visualizations, interactions, automatic methods, and quantitative measures to balance the exploration flexibility and operation efficiency, and improve the interpretability and faithfulness of the identified patterns. Case studies and quantitative experiments on multiple open datasets demonstrate the general applicability and effectiveness of our approach.",Peng Xie;Wenyuan Tao;Jie Li 0006;Wentao Huang;Siming Chen 0001,

This avoids unstable movement that does not encode data dynamics while keeping t‐SNE's neighborhood preservation ability. PCD‐tSNE scores a good balance between stability, neighborhood preservation, and distance preservation, while LD‐tSNE allows creating stable and customizable projections. We compare our methods to 11 other techniques using quality metrics and datasets provided by a recent benchmark for dynamic projections.",Eduardo Faccin Vernier;João Luiz Dihl Comba;Alexandru C.

EuroVis,2021,Texture Browser: Feature-based Texture Exploration,10.1111/cgf.14292,"AbstractTexture is a key characteristic in the definition of the physical appearance of an object and a crucial element in the creation process of 3D artists. However, retrieving a texture that matches an intended look from an image collection is difficult. Contrary to most photo collections, for which object recognition has proven quite useful, syntactic descriptions of texture characteristics is not straightforward, and even creating appropriate metadata is a very difficult task. In this paper, we propose a system to help explore large unlabeled collections of texture images. The key insight is that spatially grouping textures sharing similar features can simplify navigation. Our system uses a pre‐trained convolutional neural network to extract high‐level semantic image features, which are then mapped to a 2‐dimensional location using an adaptation of t‐SNE, a dimensionality‐reduction technique. We describe an interface to visualize and explore the resulting distribution and provide a series of enhanced navigation tools, our prioritized t‐SNE, scalable clustering, and multi‐resolution embedding, to further facilitate exploration and retrieval tasks.

EuroVis,2021,Local Extraction of 3D Time-Dependent Vector Field Topology,10.1111/cgf.14293,"AbstractWe present an approach to local extraction of 3D time‐dependent vector field topology. In this concept, Lagrangian coherent structures, which represent the separating manifolds in time‐dependent transport, correspond to generalized streak manifolds seeded along hyperbolic path surfaces (HPSs). Instead of expensive and numerically challenging direct computation of the HPSs by intersection of ridges in the forward and backward finite‐time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) fields, our approach employs local extraction of respective candidates in the four‐dimensional space‐time domain. These candidates are subsequently refined toward the hyperbolic path surfaces, which provides unsteady equivalents of saddle‐type critical points, periodic orbits, and bifurcation lines from steady, traditional vector field topology. In contrast to FTLE‐based methods, we obtain an explicit geometric representation of the topological skeleton of the flow, which for steady flows coincides with the hyperbolic invariant manifolds of vector field topology. We evaluate our approach on analytical flows, as well as data from computational fluid dynamics, using the FTLE as a ground truth superset, i.e., we also show that FTLE ridges exhibit several types of false positives.",Lutz Hofmann;Filip Sadlo,
EuroVis,2021,Parameterized Splitting of Summed Volume Tables,10.1111/cgf.14294,"AbstractSummed Volume Tables (SVTs) allow one to compute integrals over the data values in any cubical area of a three‐dimensional orthogonal grid in constant time, and they are especially interesting for building spatial search structures for sparse volumes. However, SVTs become extremely memory consuming due to the large values they need to store; for a dataset of n values an SVT requires 𝒪(n log n) bits. The 3D Fenwick tree allows recovering the integral values in 𝒪(log3 n) time, at a memory consumption of 𝒪(n) bits. We propose an algorithm that generates SVT representations that can flexibly trade speed for memory: From similar characteristics as SVTs, over equal memory consumption as 3D Fenwick trees at significantly lower computational complexity, to even further reduced memory consumption at the cost of raising computational complexity. For a 641 × 9601 × 9601 binary dataset, the algorithm can generate an SVT representation that requires 27.0GB and 46 · 8 data fetch operations to retrieve an integral value, compared to 27.5GB and 1521·8 fetches by 3D Fenwick trees, a decrease in fetches of 97%. A full SVT requires 247.6GB and 8 fetches per integral value. We present a novel hierarchical approach to compute and store intermediate prefix sums of SVTs, so that any prescribed memory consumption between 𝒪(n) bits and 𝒪(n log n) bits is achieved. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in a number of examples considering large volume data, and we perform comparisons to existing alternatives.",Christian Reinbold;Rüdiger Westermann,

By setting the number of weights of the neural network to be smaller than the input size, we achieve compressed representations of scalar fields, thus framing compression as a type of function approximation. Combined with carefully quantizing network weights, we show that this approach yields highly compact representations that outperform state‐of‐the‐art volume compression approaches. The conceptual simplicity of our approach enables a number of benefits, such as support for time‐varying scalar fields, optimizing to preserve spatial gradients, and random‐access field evaluation.

EuroVis,2021,Thin-Volume Visualization on Curved Domains,10.1111/cgf.14296,"AbstractThin, curved structures occur in many volumetric datasets. Their analysis using classical volume rendering is difficult because parts of such structures can bend away or hide behind occluding elements. This problem cannot be fully compensated by effective navigation alone, as structure‐adapted navigation in the volume is cumbersome and only parts of the structure are visible in each view. We solve this problem by rendering a spatially transformed view of the volume so that an unobstructed visualization of the entire curved structure is obtained. As a result, simple and intuitive navigation becomes possible. The domain of the spatial transform is defined by a triangle mesh that is topologically equivalent to an open disc and that approximates the structure of interest. The rendering is based on ray‐casting, in which the rays traverse the original volume. In order to carve out volumes of varying thicknesses, the lengths of the rays as well as the positions of the mesh vertices can be easily modified by interactive painting under view control.We describe a prototypical implementation and demonstrate the interactive visual inspection of complex structures from digital humanities, biology, medicine, and material sciences. The visual representation of the structure as a whole allows for easy inspection of interesting substructures in their original spatial context. Overall, we show that thin, curved structures in volumetric data can be excellently visualized using ray‐casting‐based volume rendering of transformed views defined by guiding surface meshes, supplemented by interactive, local modifications of ray lengths and vertex positions.",Felix Herter;Hans-Christian Hege;Markus Hadwiger;Verena Lepper;Daniel Baum,

EuroVis,2021,VisEvol: Visual Analytics to Support Hyperparameter Search through Evolutionary Optimization,10.1111/cgf.14300,"AbstractDuring the training phase of machine learning (ML) models, it is usually necessary to configure several hyperparameters. This process is computationally intensive and requires an extensive search to infer the best hyperparameter set for the given problem. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that most ML models are complex internally, and training involves trial‐and‐error processes that could remarkably affect the predictive result. Moreover, each hyperparameter of an ML algorithm is potentially intertwined with the others, and changing it might result in unforeseeable impacts on the remaining hyperparameters. Evolutionary optimization is a promising method to try and address those issues. According to this method, performant models are stored, while the remainder are improved through crossover and mutation processes inspired by genetic algorithms. We present VisEvol, a visual analytics tool that supports interactive exploration of hyperparameters and intervention in this evolutionary procedure. In summary, our proposed tool helps the user to generate new models through evolution and eventually explore powerful hyperparameter combinations in diverse regions of the extensive hyperparameter space. The outcome is a voting ensemble (with equal rights) that boosts the final predictive performance.

EuroVis,2021,Learning Contextualized User Preferences for Co-Adaptive Guidance in Mixed-Initiative Topic Model Refinement,10.1111/cgf.14301,"AbstractMixed‐initiative visual analytics systems support collaborative human‐machine decision‐making processes. However, many multi‐objective optimization tasks, such as topic model refinement, are highly subjective and context‐dependent. Hence, systems need to adapt their optimization suggestions throughout the interactive refinement process to provide efficient guidance. To tackle this challenge, we present a technique for learning context‐dependent user preferences and demonstrate its applicability to topic model refinement. We deploy agents with distinct associated optimization strategies that compete for the user's acceptance of their suggestions. To decide when to provide guidance, each agent maintains an intelligible, rule‐based classifier over context vectorizations that captures the development of quality metrics between distinct analysis states. By observing implicit and explicit user feedback, agents learn in which contexts to provide their specific guidance operation. An agent in topic model refinement might, for example, learn to react to declining model coherence by suggesting to split a topic. Our results confirm that the rules learned by agents capture contextual user preferences. Further, we show that the learned rules are transferable between similar datasets, avoiding common cold‐start problems and enabling a continuous refinement of agents across corpora.",Fabian Sperrle;Hanna Schäfer;Daniel A.

Visualizing the execution traces can reduce the cognitive burden of users and facilitate making sense of behaviors of GPU hardware components. In this paper, we first formalize the process of GPU performance analysis and characterize the design requirements of visualizing execution traces based on a survey study and interviews with GPU hardware designers. We contribute data and task abstraction for GPU performance analysis.

EuroVis,2021,Leveraging Topological Events in Tracking Graphs for Understanding Particle Diffusion,10.1111/cgf.14304,"AbstractSingle particle tracking (SPT) of fluorescent molecules provides significant insights into the diffusion and relative motion of tagged proteins and other structures of interest in biology. However, despite the latest advances in high‐resolution microscopy, individual particles are typically not distinguished from clusters of particles. This lack of resolution obscures potential evidence for how merging and splitting of particles affect their diffusion and any implications on the biological environment. The particle tracks are typically decomposed into individual segments at observed merge and split events, and analysis is performed without knowing the true count of particles in the resulting segments. Here, we address the challenges in analyzing particle tracks in the context of cancer biology. In particular, we study the tracks of KRAS protein, which is implicated in nearly 20% of all human cancers, and whose clustering and aggregation have been linked to the signaling pathway leading to uncontrolled cell growth. We present a new analysis approach for particle tracks by representing them as tracking graphs and using topological events – merging and splitting, to disambiguate the tracks. Using this analysis, we infer a lower bound on the count of particles as they cluster and create conditional distributions of diffusion speeds before and after merge and split events. Using thousands of time‐steps of simulated and in‐vitro SPT data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, as it offers the biologists a new, detailed look into the relationship between KRAS clustering and diffusion speeds.",Torin McDonald;Rebika Shrestha;Xiyu Yi;Harsh Bhatia;De Chen;Debanjan Goswami;Valerio Pascucci;Thomas Turbyville;Peer-Timo Bremer,
EuroVis,2021,SumRe: Design and Evaluation of a Gist-based Summary Visualization for Incident Reports Triage,10.1111/cgf.14305,"AbstractIncident report triage is a common endeavor in many industry sectors, often coupled with serious public safety implications. For example, at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), analysts triage an influx of incident reports to identify previously undiscovered drug safety problems. However, these analysts currently conduct this critical yet error‐prone incident report triage using a generic table‐based interface, with no formal support. Visualization design, task‐characterization methodologies, and evaluation models offer several possibilities for better supporting triage workflows, including those dealing with drug safety and beyond. In this work, we aim to elevate the work of triage through a task‐abstraction activity with FDA analysts. Second, we design an alternative gist‐based summary of text documents used in triage (SumRe). Third, we conduct a crowdsourced evaluation of SumRe with medical experts. Results of the crowdsourced study with medical experts (n = 20) suggest that SumRe better supports accuracy in understanding the gist of a given report, and in identifying important reports for followup activities. We discuss implications of these results, including design considerations for triage workflows beyond the drug domain, as well as methodologies for comparing visualization‐enabled text summaries.",Tabassum Kakar;Xiao Qin 0003;Thang La;Sanjay K.

EuroVis,2021,SenVis: Interactive Tensor-based Sensitivity Visualization,10.1111/cgf.14306,"AbstractSobol's method is one of the most powerful and widely used frameworks for global sensitivity analysis, and it maps every possible combination of input variables to an associated Sobol index. However, these indices are often challenging to analyze in depth, due in part to the lack of suitable, flexible enough, and fast‐to‐query data access structures as well as visualization techniques. We propose a visualization tool that leverages tensor decomposition, a compressed data format that can quickly and approximately answer sophisticated queries over exponential‐sized sets of Sobol indices. This way, we are able to capture the complete global sensitivity information of high‐dimensional scalar models. Our application is based on a three‐stage visualization, to which variables to be analyzed can be added or removed interactively. It includes a novel hourglass‐like diagram presenting the relative importance for any single variable or combination of input variables with respect to any composition of the rest of the input variables. We showcase our visualization with a range of example models, whereby we demonstrate the high expressive power and analytical capability made possible with the proposed method.",Haiyan Yang;Rafael Ballester-Ripoll;Renato Pajarola,
EuroVis,2021,Visual Analysis of Electronic Densities and Transitions in Molecules,10.1111/cgf.14307,AbstractThe study of electronic transitions within a molecule connected to the absorption or emission of light is a common task in the process of the design of new materials. The transitions are complex quantum mechanical processes and a detailed analysis requires a breakdown of these processes into components that can be interpreted via characteristic chemical properties. We approach these tasks by providing a detailed analysis of the electron density field. This entails methods to quantify and visualize electron localization and transfer from molecular subgroups combining spatial and abstract representations. The core of our method uses geometric segmentation of the electronic density field coupled with a graph‐theoretic formulation of charge transfer between molecular subgroups. The design of the methods has been guided by the goal of providing a generic and objective analysis following fundamental concepts. We illustrate the proposed approach using several case studies involving the study of electronic transitions in different molecular systems.,Talha Bin Masood;Signe Sidwall Thygesen;Mathieu Linares;Alexei I.

Our tool was designed with and evaluated by meteorologists and expert forecasters working in short‐term operational weather forecasting of severe weather events. Results show that our solution suits the forecasters' workflow. Our visual design is expressive, easy to use, and effective for prompt analysis and quick decision‐making in the context of short‐range operational weather forecasting.",Alexandra Diehl;Leandro Pelorosso;Juan Ruiz 0002;Renato Pajarola;M.

EuroVis,2021,A Deeper Understanding of Visualization-Text Interplay in Geographic Data-driven Stories,10.1111/cgf.14309,"AbstractData‐driven stories comprise of visualizations and a textual narrative. The two representations coexist and complement each other. Although existing research has explored the design strategies and structure of such stories, it remains an open research question how the two representations play together on a detailed level and how they are linked with each other. In this paper, we aim at understanding the fine‐grained interplay of text and visualizations in geographic data‐driven stories. We focus on geographic content as it often includes complex spatiotemporal data presented as versatile visualizations and rich textual descriptions. We conduct a qualitative empirical study on 22 stories collected from a variety of news media outlets; 10 of the stories report the COVID‐19 pandemic, the others cover diverse topics. We investigate the role of every sentence and visualization within the narrative to reveal how they reference each other and interact. Moreover, we explore the positioning and sequence of various parts of the narrative to find patterns that further consolidate the stories. Drawing from the findings, we discuss study implications with respect to best practices and possibilities to automate the report generation.",Shahid Latif;Siming Chen 0001;Fabian Beck 0001,
EuroVis,2021,Design Space of Origin-Destination Data Visualization,10.1111/cgf.14310,"AbstractVisualization is an essential tool for observing and analyzing origin‐destination (OD) data, which encodes flows between geographic locations, e.g., in applications concerning commuting, migration, and transport of goods. However, depicting OD data often encounter issues of cluttering and occlusion. To address these issues, many visual designs feature data abstraction and visual abstraction, such as node aggregation and edge bundling, resulting in information loss. The recent theoretical and empirical developments in visualization have substantiated the merits of such abstraction, while confirming that viewers' knowledge can alleviate the negative impact due to information loss. It is thus desirable to map out different ways of losing and adding information in origin‐destination data visualization (ODDV). We therefore formulate a new design space of ODDV based on the categorization of informative operations on OD data in data abstraction and visual abstraction. We apply this design space to existing ODDV methods, outline strategies for exploring the design space, and suggest ideas for further exploration.",Martijn Tennekes;Min Chen 0001,
EuroVis,2021,Visual Analysis of Spatio-temporal Phenomena with 1D Projections,10.1111/cgf.14311,"AbstractIt is crucial to visually extrapolate the characteristics of their evolution to understand critical spatio‐temporal events such as earthquakes, fires, or the spreading of a disease. Animations embedded in the spatial context can be helpful for understanding details, but have proven to be less effective for overview and comparison tasks. We present an interactive approach for the exploration of spatio‐temporal data, based on a set of neighborhood‐preserving 1D projections which help identify patterns and support the comparison of numerous time steps and multivariate data. An important objective of the proposed approach is the visual description of local neighborhoods in the 1D projection to reveal patterns of similarity and propagation. As this locality cannot generally be guaranteed, we provide a selection of different projection techniques, as well as a hierarchical approach, to support the analysis of different data characteristics. In addition, we offer an interactive exploration technique to reorganize and improve the mapping locally to users' foci of interest. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with different real‐world application scenarios and discuss the feedback we received from domain and visualization experts.",Max Franke;Henry Martin;Steffen Koch 0001;Kuno Kurzhals,
EuroVis,2021,Boundary Objects in Design Studies: Reflections on the Collaborative Creation of Isochrone Maps,10.1111/cgf.14312,"AbstractWe propose to take an artifact‐centric approach to design studies by leveraging the concept of boundary object. Design studies typically focus on processes and articulate design decisions in a project‐specific context with a goal of transferability. We argue that design studies could benefit from paying attention to the material conditions in which teams collaborate to reach design outcomes. We report on a design study of isochrone maps following cartographic generalization principles. Focusing on boundary objects enables us to characterize five categories of artifacts and tools that facilitated collaboration between actors involved in the design process (structured collections, structuring artifacts, process‐centric artifacts, generative artifacts, and bridging artifacts). We found that artifacts such as layered maps and map collections played a unifying role for our inter‐disciplinary team. We discuss how such artifacts can be pivotal in the design process. Finally, we discuss how considering boundary objects could improve the transferability of design study results, and support reflection on inter‐disciplinary collaboration in the domain of Information Visualization.",Romain Vuillemot;Ph.

EuroVis,2021,ParSetgnostics: Quality Metrics for Parallel Sets,10.1111/cgf.14314,"AbstractWhile there are many visualization techniques for exploring numeric data, only a few work with categorical data. One prominent example is Parallel Sets, showing data frequencies instead of data points ‐ analogous to parallel coordinates for numerical data. As nominal data does not have an intrinsic order, the design of Parallel Sets is sensitive to visual clutter due to overlaps, crossings, and subdivision of ribbons hindering readability and pattern detection. In this paper, we propose a set of quality metrics, called ParSetgnostics (Parallel Sets diagnostics), which aim to improve Parallel Sets by reducing clutter. These quality metrics quantify important properties of Parallel Sets such as overlap, orthogonality, ribbon width variance, and mutual information to optimize the category and dimension ordering. By conducting a systematic correlation analysis between the individual metrics, we ensure their distinctiveness. Further, we evaluate the clutter reduction effect of ParSetgnostics by reconstructing six datasets from previous publications using Parallel Sets measuring and comparing their respective properties. Our results show that ParSetgostics facilitates multi‐dimensional analysis of categorical data by automatically providing optimized Parallel Set designs with a clutter reduction of up to 81% compared to the originally proposed Parallel Sets visualizations.",Frederik L.

EuroVis,2021,A novel approach for exploring annotated data with interactive lenses,10.1111/cgf.14315,"AbstractWe introduce a novel approach for assisting users in exploring 2D data representations with an interactive lens. Focus‐and‐context exploration is supported by translating user actions to the joint adjustments in camera and lens parameters that ensure a good placement and sizing of the lens within the view. This general approach, implemented using standard device mappings, overcomes the limitations of current solutions, which force users to continuously switch from lens positioning and scaling to view panning and zooming. Navigation is further assisted by exploiting data annotations. In addition to traditional visual markups and information links, we associate to each annotation a lens configuration that highlights the region of interest. During interaction, an assisting controller determines the next best lens in the database based on the current view and lens parameters and the navigation history. Then, the controller interactively guides the user's lens towards the selected target and displays its annotation markup. As only one annotation markup is displayed at a time, clutter is reduced. Moreover, in addition to guidance, the navigation can also be automated to create a tour through the data. While our methods are generally applicable to general 2D visualization, we have implemented them for the exploration of stratigraphic relightable models. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated in cultural heritage use cases. A user study has been performed in order to validate our approach.",Fabio Bettio;Moonisa Ahsan;Fabio Marton;Enrico Gobbetti,
EuroVis,2021,Line Weaver: Importance-Driven Order Enhanced Rendering of Dense Line Charts,10.1111/cgf.14316,"AbstractLine charts are an effective and widely used technique for visualizing series of ordered two‐dimensional data points. The relationship between consecutive points is indicated by connecting line segments, revealing potential trends or clusters in the underlying data. However, when dealing with an increasing number of lines, the render order substantially influences the resulting visualization. Rendering transparent lines can help but unfortunately the blending order is currently either ignored or naively used, for example, assuming it is implicitly given by the order in which the data was saved in a file. Due to the non‐commutativity of classic alpha blending, this results in contradicting visualizations of the same underlying data set, so‐called “hallucinators”. In this paper, we therefore present line weaver, a novel visualization technique for dense line charts. Using an importance function, we developed an approach that correctly considers the blending order independently of the render order and without any prior sorting of the data. We allow for importance functions which are either explicitly given or implicitly derived from the geometric properties of the data if no external data is available. The importance can then be applied globally to entire lines, or locally per pixel which simultaneously supports various types of user interaction. Finally, we discuss the potential of our contribution based on different synthetic and real‐world data sets where classic or naive approaches would fail.",Thomas Trautner;Stefan Bruckner,
EuroVis,2021,A Progressive Approach for Uncertainty Visualization in Diffusion Tensor Imaging,10.1111/cgf.14317,"AbstractDiffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a non‐invasive magnetic resonance imaging technique that, combined with fiber tracking algorithms, allows the characterization and visualization of white matter structures in the brain. The resulting fiber tracts are used, for example, in tumor surgery to evaluate the potential brain functional damage due to tumor resection. The DTI processing pipeline from image acquisition to the final visualization is rather complex generating undesirable uncertainties in the final results. Most DTI visualization techniques do not provide any information regarding the presence of uncertainty. When planning surgery, a fixed safety margin around the fiber tracts is often used; however, it cannot capture local variability and distribution of the uncertainty, thereby limiting the informed decision‐making process. Stochastic techniques are a possibility to estimate uncertainty for the DTI pipeline. However, it has high computational and memory requirements that make it infeasible in a clinical setting. The delay in the visualization of the results adds hindrance to the workflow. We propose a progressive approach that relies on a combination of wild‐bootstrapping and fiber tracking to be used within the progressive visual analytics paradigm. We present a local bootstrapping strategy, which reduces the computational and memory costs, and provides fiber‐tracking results in a progressive manner. We have also implemented a progressive aggregation technique that computes the distances in the fiber ensemble during progressive bootstrap computations. We present experiments with different scenarios to highlight the benefits of using our progressive visual analytic pipeline in a clinical workflow along with a use case and analysis obtained by discussions with our collaborators.",Faizan Siddiqui;Thomas Höllt;Anna Vilanova,
EuroVis,2021,Implicit Modeling of Patient-Specific Aortic Dissections with Elliptic Fourier Descriptors,10.1111/cgf.14318,"AbstractAortic dissection is a life‐threatening vascular disease characterized by abrupt formation of a new flow channel (false lumen) within the aortic wall. Survivors of the acute phase remain at high risk for late complications, such as aneurysm formation, rupture, and death. Morphologic features of aortic dissection determine not only treatment strategies in the acute phase (surgical vs. endovascular vs. medical), but also modulate the hemodynamics in the false lumen, ultimately responsible for late complications. Accurate description of the true and false lumen, any communications across the dissection membrane separating the two lumina, and blood supply from each lumen to aortic branch vessels is critical for risk prediction. Patient‐specific surface representations are also a prerequisite for hemodynamic simulations, but currently require time‐consuming manual segmentation of CT data. We present an aortic dissection cross‐sectional model that captures the varying aortic anatomy, allowing for reliable measurements and creation of high‐quality surface representations. In contrast to the traditional spline‐based cross‐sectional model, we employ elliptic Fourier descriptors, which allows users to control the accuracy of the cross‐sectional contour of a flow channel. We demonstrate (i) how our approach can solve the requirements for generating surface and wall representations of the flow channels, (ii) how any number of communications between flow channels can be specified in a consistent manner, and (iii) how well branches connected to the respective flow channels are handled. Finally, we discuss how our approach is a step forward to an automated generation of surface models for aortic dissections from raw 3D imaging segmentation masks.",Gabriel Mistelbauer;Christian Rössl;Kathrin Bäumler;Bernhard Preim;Dominik Fleischmann,
EuroVis,2021,Visualizing Carotid Blood Flow Simulations for Stroke Prevention,10.1111/cgf.14319,"AbstractIn this work, we investigate how concepts from medical flow visualization can be applied to enhance stroke prevention diagnostics. Our focus lies on carotid stenoses, i.e., local narrowings of the major brain‐supplying arteries, which are a frequent cause of stroke. Carotid surgery can reduce the stroke risk associated with stenoses, however, the procedure entails risks itself. Therefore, a thorough assessment of each case is necessary. In routine diagnostics, the morphology and hemodynamics of an afflicted vessel are separately analyzed using angiography and sonography, respectively. Blood flow simulations based on computational fluid dynamics could enable the visual integration of hemodynamic and morphological information and provide a higher resolution on relevant parameters. We identify and abstract the tasks involved in the assessment of stenoses and investigate how clinicians could derive relevant insights from carotid blood flow simulations. We adapt and refine a combination of techniques to facilitate this purpose, integrating spatiotemporal navigation, dimensional reduction, and contextual embedding. We evaluated and discussed our approach with an interdisciplinary group of medical practitioners, fluid simulation and flow visualization researchers. Our initial findings indicate that visualization techniques could promote usage of carotid blood flow simulations in practice.",Pepe Eulzer;Monique Meuschke;Carsten M. Klingner;Kai Lawonn,
EuroVis,2021,VICE: Visual Identification and Correction of Neural Circuit Errors,10.1111/cgf.14320,"AbstractA connectivity graph of neurons at the resolution of single synapses provides scientists with a tool for understanding the nervous system in health and disease. Recent advances in automatic image segmentation and synapse prediction in electron microscopy (EM) datasets of the brain have made reconstructions of neurons possible at the nanometer scale. However, automatic segmentation sometimes struggles to segment large neurons correctly, requiring human effort to proofread its output. General proofreading involves inspecting large volumes to correct segmentation errors at the pixel level, a visually intensive and time‐consuming process. This paper presents the design and implementation of an analytics framework that streamlines proofreading, focusing on connectivity‐related errors. We accomplish this with automated likely‐error detection and synapse clustering that drives the proofreading effort with highly interactive 3D visualizations. In particular, our strategy centers on proofreading the local circuit of a single cell to ensure a basic level of completeness. We demonstrate our framework's utility with a user study and report quantitative and subjective feedback from our users.

We contribute a detailed characterization of responsive visualization strategies in communication‐oriented visualizations, identifying 76 total strategies by analyzing 378 pairs of large screen (LS) and small screen (SS) visualizations from online articles and reports. Our analysis distinguishes between the Targets of responsive visualization, referring to what elements of a design are changed and Actions representing how targets are changed. We identify key trade‐offs related to authors' need to maintain graphical density, referring to the amount of information per pixel, while also maintaining the “message” or intended takeaways for users of a visualization.

EuroVis,2021,ClusterSets: Optimizing Planar Clusters in Categorical Point Data,10.1111/cgf.14322,"AbstractIn geographic data analysis, one is often given point data of different categories (such as facilities of a university categorized by department). Drawing upon recent research on set visualization, we want to visualize category membership by connecting points of the same category with visual links. Existing approaches that follow this path usually insist on connecting all members of a category, which may lead to many crossings and visual clutter. We propose an approach that avoids crossings between connections of different categories completely. Instead of connecting all data points of the same category, we subdivide categories into smaller, local clusters where needed. We do a case study comparing the legibility of drawings produced by our approach and those by existing approaches.In our problem formulation, we are additionally given a graph G on the data points whose edges express some sort of proximity. Our aim is to find a subgraph G′ of G with the following properties: (i) edges connect only data points of the same category, (ii) no two edges cross, and (iii) the number of connected components (clusters) is minimized. We then visualize the clusters in G′. For arbitrary graphs, the resulting optimization problem, Cluster Minimization, is NP‐hard (even to approximate). Therefore, we introduce two heuristics. We do an extensive benchmark test on real‐world data. Comparisons with exact solutions indicate that our heuristics do astonishing well for certain relative‐neighborhood graphs.",Jakob Geiger;Sabine Cornelsen;Jan-Henrik Haunert;Philipp Kindermann;Tamara Mchedlidze;Martin Nöllenburg;Yoshio Okamoto;Alexander Wolff 0001,
EuroVis,2021,Optimal Axes for Data Value Estimation in Star Coordinates and Radial Axes Plots,10.1111/cgf.14323,"AbstractRadial axes plots are projection methods that represent high‐dimensional data samples as points on a two‐dimensional plane. These techniques define mappings through a set of axis vectors, each associated with a data variable, which users can manipulate interactively to create different plots and analyze data from multiple points of view. However, updating the direction and length of an axis vector is far from trivial. Users must consider the data analysis task, domain knowledge, the directions in which values should increase, the relative importance of each variable, or the correlations between variables, among other factors. Another issue is the difficulty to approximate high‐dimensional data values in the two‐dimensional visualizations, which can hamper searching for data with particular characteristics, analyzing the most common data values in clusters, inspecting outliers, etc. In this paper we present and analyze several optimization approaches for enhancing radial axes plots regarding their ability to represent high‐dimensional data values. The techniques can be used not only to approximate data values with greater accuracy, but also to guide users when updating axis vectors or extending visualizations with new variables, since they can reveal poor choices of axis vectors. The optimal axes can also be included in nonlinear plots. In particular, we show how they can be used within RadViz to assess the quality of a variable ordering. The in‐depth analysis carried out is useful for visualization designers developing radial axes techniques, or planning to incorporate axes into other visualization methods.",Manuel Rubio-Sánchez;Dirk J.

However, crafting a data video is often time‐consuming and asks for various domain knowledge such as data visualization, animation design, and screenwriting. Existing authoring tools usually enable users to edit and compose a set of templates manually, which still cost a lot of human effort. To further lower the barrier of creating data videos, this work introduces a new approach, AutoClips, which can automatically generate data videos given the input of a sequence of data facts. We built AutoClips through two stages. First, we constructed a fact‐driven clip library where we mapped ten data facts to potential animated visualizations respectively by analyzing 230 online data videos and conducting interviews. Next, we constructed an algorithm that generates data videos from data facts through three steps: selecting and identifying the optimal clip for each of the data facts, arranging the clips into a coherent video, and optimizing the duration of the video. The results from two user studies indicated that the data videos generated by AutoClips are comprehensible, engaging, and have comparable quality with human‐made videos.",D. Shi;F. Sun;X.

EuroVis,2021,Uncertainty-aware Visualization of Regional Time Series Correlation in Spatio-temporal Ensembles,10.1111/cgf.14326,"AbstractGiven a time‐varying scalar field, the analysis of correlations between different spatial regions, i.e., the linear dependence of time series within these regions, provides insights into the structural properties of the data. In this context, regions are connected components of the spatial domain with high time series correlations. The detection and analysis of such regions is often performed globally, which requires pairwise correlation computations that are quadratic in the number of spatial data samples. Thus, operations based on all pairwise correlations are computationally demanding, especially when dealing with ensembles that model the uncertainty in the spatio‐temporal phenomena using multiple simulation runs. We propose a two‐step procedure: In a first step, we map the spatial samples to a 3D embedding based on a pairwise correlation matrix computed from the ensemble of time series. The 3D embedding allows for a one‐to‐one mapping to a 3D color space such that the outcome can be visually investigated by rendering the colors for all samples in the spatial domain. In a second step, we generate a hierarchical image segmentation based on the color images. From then on, we can visually analyze correlations of regions at all levels in the hierarchy within an interactive setting, which includes the uncertainty‐aware analysis of the region's time series correlation and respective time lags.",Marina Evers;Karim Huesmann;Lars Linsen,

Each of these steps is affected by uncertainty, which can highly influence the decision‐making process of clinicians. Visualization can help in understanding and communicating these uncertainties. In this manuscript, we aim to summarize the current state‐of‐the‐art in uncertainty‐aware visualization in medical imaging. Our report is based on the steps involved in medical imaging as well as its applications. Requirements are formulated to examine the considered approaches. In addition, this manuscript shows which approaches can be combined to form uncertainty‐aware medical imaging pipelines.

Although these techniques have found widespread adoption in high‐performance computing simulations, visualizing their data output interactively and without cracks or artifacts remains challenging. In this paper, we present an efficient solution for direct volume rendering and hybrid implicit isosurface ray tracing of tree‐based AMR (TB‐AMR) data. We propose a novel reconstruction strategy, Generalized Trilinear Interpolation (GTI), to interpolate across AMR level boundaries without cracks or discontinuities in the surface normal. We employ a general sparse octree structure supporting a wide range of AMR data, and use it to accelerate volume rendering, hybrid implicit isosurface rendering and value queries. We demonstrate that our approach achieves artifact‐free isosurface and volume rendering and provides higher quality output images compared to existing methods at interactive rendering rates.",Feng Wang 0013;Nathan Marshak;William Usher 0001;Carsten Burstedde;Aaron Knoll;Timo Heister;Chris R.

EuroVis,2020,Knowledge-Assisted Comparative Assessment of Breast Cancer using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging,10.1111/cgf.13959,"AbstractBreast perfusion data are dynamic medical image data that depict perfusion characteristics of the investigated tissue. These data consist of a series of static datasets that are acquired at different time points and aggregated into time intensity curves (TICs) for each voxel. The characteristics of these TICs provide important information about a lesion's composition, but their analysis is time‐consuming due to their large number. Subsequently, these TICs are used to classify a lesion as benign or malignant. This lesion scoring is commonly done manually by physicians and may therefore be subject to bias. We propose an approach that addresses both of these problems by combining an automated lesion classification with a visual confirmatory analysis, especially for uncertain cases. Firstly, we cluster the TICs of a lesion using ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) and then visualize these clusters. Together with their relative size, they are added to a library. We then model fuzzy inference rules by using the lesion's TIC clusters as antecedents and its score as consequent. Using a fuzzy scoring system, we can suggest a score for a new lesion. Secondly, to allow physicians to confirm the suggestion in uncertain cases, we display the TIC clusters together with their spatial distribution and allow them to compare two lesions side by side. With our knowledge‐assisted comparative visual analysis, physicians can explore and classify breast lesions. The true positive prediction accuracy of our scoring system achieved 71.4 % in one‐fold cross‐validation using 14 lesions.",Kai Nie;Pascal A. Baltzer;Bernhard Preim;Gabriel Mistelbauer,
EuroVis,2020,Hairy Slices II: Depth Cues for Visualizing 3D Streamlines Through Cutting Planes,10.1111/cgf.13960,"AbstractVisualizing 3D vector fields is challenging because of occlusion problems and the difficulty of providing depth cues that adequately support the perception of direction of flow lines in 3D space. One of the depth cues that has proven most valuable for the perception of other kinds of 3D data, notably 3D networks and 3D point clouds, is structure‐from‐motion (also called the Kinetic Depth Effect); another powerful depth cue is stereoscopic viewing. We carried out an experiment of the perception of direction for short streamlines passing through a cutting plane. The conditions included viewing with and without structure‐from‐motion and with and without stereoscopic depth. Conditions also include comparing streamtubes to lines. The results show that for this particular task, stereo provided an effective depth cue, but structure‐from‐motion did not. Ringed streamtubes and streamcones provided good 3D direction information, even without stereoscopic viewing. We conclude with guidelines for viewing slices through vector fields.",Andrew H.

EuroVis,2020,Representative Isovalue Detection and Isosurface Segmentation Using Novel Isosurface Measures,10.1111/cgf.13961,"AbstractInterval volume is the volume of the region between two isosurfaces. This paper proposes a novel measure, called VOA measure, that is computed based on interval volume and isosurface area. This measure represents the rate of change of distance between isosurfaces with respect to isovalue. It can be used to detect representative isovalues of the dataset since two isosurfaces near material boundaries tend to be much closer to each other than two isosurfaces in material interiors, assuming they have the same isovalue difference. For the same isosurface, some portion of it may pass through the boundary of two materials and some portion of it may pass through the interior of a material. To separate the portions of an isosurface that represent different features of the dataset, another novel isosurface measure is introduced. This measure is calculated based on the Euclidean distance of individual sample points on two isosurfaces. The effectiveness of the two new measures in detecting significant isovalues and segmenting isosurfaces are demonstrated in the paper.",Cuilan Wang,

This memory is composed of large temporal vectors updated when the agent moves in an environment and is not trivial to understand due to the number of dimensions, dependencies to past vectors, spatial/temporal correlations, and co‐correlation between dimensions. It is often referred to as a black box as only inputs (images) and outputs (actions) are intelligible for humans. Using DRLViz, experts are assisted to interpret decisions using memory reduction interactions, and to investigate the role of parts of the memory when errors have been made (e.g. wrong direction). We report on DRLViz applied in the context of video games simulators (ViZDoom) for a navigation scenario with item gathering tasks.

In this design study, in an iterative design process, we developed glyphs as a design for seamlessly encoding relationships and movement characteristics of a single mover or clusters of movers. Based on these glyph designs, we developed a visual exploration prototype, MotionGlyphs, that supports domain experts in interactively filtering, clustering, and animating spatio‐temporal networks for collective animal behavior analysis.

Examining the notions of scalability and elasticity in interactive visualizations, we introduce a visualization of personal reading traces such as marginalia or markings inside the reference library of German realist author Theodor Fontane. To explore such a rich and extensive collection, meaningful visual forms of abstraction and detail are as important as the transitions between those states. Following a growing research interest in the role of fluid interactivity and animations between views, we are particularly interested in the potential of carefully designed transitions and consistent representations across scales. The resulting prototype addresses humanistic research questions about the interplay of distant and close reading with visualization research on continuous navigation along several granularity levels, using scrolling as one of the main interaction mechanisms. In addition to presenting the design process and resulting prototype, we present findings from a qualitative evaluation of the tool, which suggest that bridging between distant and close views can enhance exploration, but that transitions between views need to be crafted very carefully to facilitate comprehension.",Mark-Jan Bludau;Viktoria Brüggemann;Anna Busch;Marian Dörk,

We propose a visualization approach that shows an overview of multiple games, with a detailed timeline‐based visualization for exploring the specifics of each game.

Police departments frequently use hotspot analysis to identify regions that should be a priority in receiving preventive resources. Practitioners and researchers agree that tracking crime over time and identifying its geographic patterns are vital information for planning efficiently. Frequently, police departments have access to systems that are too complicated and excessively technical, leading to modest usage. By working closely together with domain experts from police agencies of two different countries, we identified and characterized five domain tasks inherent to the hotspot analysis problem and developed SHOC, a visualization tool that strives for simplicity and ease of use in helping users to perform all the domain tasks. SHOC is included in a visual analytics system that allows users without technical expertise to annotate, save, and share analyses.

Machine learning algorithms allow for flexible specification of such meta‐information through the design of the objective functions that they solve. However, such objective functions are hard for users to specify as they are a specific mathematical formulation of their intents. In this paper, we present an approach that allows users to generate objective functions for classification problems through an interactive visual interface. Our approach adopts a semantic interaction design in that user interactions over data elements in the visualization are translated into objective function terms. The generated objective functions are solved by a machine learning solver that provides candidate models, which can be inspected by the user, and used to suggest refinements to the specifications. We demonstrate a visual analytics system QUESTO for users to manipulate objective functions to define domain‐specific constraints.

EuroVis,2020,Peax : Interactive Visual Pattern Search in Sequential Data Using Unsupervised Deep Representation Learning,10.1111/cgf.13971,"AbstractWe present Peax, a novel feature‐based technique for interactive visual pattern search in sequential data, like time series or data mapped to a genome sequence. Visually searching for patterns by similarity is often challenging because of the large search space, the visual complexity of patterns, and the user's perception of similarity. For example, in genomics, researchers try to link patterns in multivariate sequential data to cellular or pathogenic processes, but a lack of ground truth and high variance makes automatic pattern detection unreliable. We have developed a convolutional autoencoder for unsupervised representation learning of regions in sequential data that can capture more visual details of complex patterns compared to existing similarity measures. Using this learned representation as features of the sequential data, our accompanying visual query system enables interactive feedback‐driven adjustments of the pattern search to adapt to the users’ perceived similarity. Using an active learning sampling strategy, Peax collects user‐generated binary relevance feedback. This feedback is used to train a model for binary classification, to ultimately find other regions that exhibit patterns similar to the search target. We demonstrate Peax's features through a case study in genomics and report on a user study with eight domain experts to assess the usability and usefulness of Peax. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of the learned feature representation for visual similarity search in two additional user studies. We find that our models retrieve significantly more similar patterns than other commonly used techniques.",Fritz Lekschas;Brant Peterson;Daniel Haehn;Eric Ma;Nils Gehlenborg;Hanspeter Pfister,

EuroVis,2020,Classifier-Guided Visual Correction of Noisy Labels for Image Classification Tasks,10.1111/cgf.13973,"AbstractTraining data plays an essential role in modern applications of machine learning. However, gathering labeled training data is time‐consuming. Therefore, labeling is often outsourced to less experienced users, or completely automated. This can introduce errors, which compromise valuable training data, and lead to suboptimal training results. We thus propose a novel approach that uses the power of pretrained classifiers to visually guide users to noisy labels, and let them interactively check error candidates, to iteratively improve the training data set. To systematically investigate training data, we propose a categorization of labeling errors into three different types, based on an analysis of potential pitfalls in label acquisition processes. For each of these types, we present approaches to detect, reason about, and resolve error candidates, as we propose measures and visual guidance techniques to support machine learning users. Our approach has been used to spot errors in well‐known machine learning benchmark data sets, and we tested its usability during a user evaluation. While initially developed for images, the techniques presented in this paper are independent of the classification algorithm, and can also be extended to many other types of training data.",Alex Bäuerle;Heiko Neumann;Timo Ropinski,

To understand the composition of animated data graphics, we survey real‐world examples and contribute a description of the design space. We characterize animated transitions based on object, graphic, data, and timing dimensions. We synthesize the primitives from the object, graphic, and data dimensions as a set of 10 transition types, and describe how timing primitives compose broader pacing techniques. We then conduct an ideation study that uncovers how people approach animation creation with three authoring paradigms: keyframe animation, procedural animation, and presets &amp; templates. Our analysis shows that designers have an overall preference for keyframe animation. However, we find evidence that an authoring tool should combine these three paradigms as designers’ preferences depend on the characteristics of the animated transition design and the authoring task.

EuroVis,2020,VisuaLint: Sketchy In Situ Annotations of Chart Construction Errors,10.1111/cgf.13975,"AbstractChart construction errors, such as truncated axes or inexpressive visual encodings, can hinder reading a visualization, or worse, imply misleading facts about the underlying data. These errors can be caught by critical readings of visualizations, but readers must have a high level of data and design literacy and must be paying close attention. To address this issue, we introduce VisuaLint: a technique for surfacing chart construction errors in situ. Inspired by the ubiquitous red wavy underline that indicates spelling mistakes, visualization elements that contain errors (e.g., axes and legends) are sketchily rendered and accompanied by a concise annotation. VisuaLint is unobtrusive — it does not interfere with reading a visualization — and its direct display establishes a close mapping between erroneous elements and the expression of error. We demonstrate five examples of VisualLint and present the results of a crowdsourced evaluation (N = 62) of its efficacy. These results contribute an empirical baseline proficiency for recognizing chart construction errors, and indicate near‐universal difficulty in error identification. We find that people more reliably identify chart construction errors after being shown examples of VisuaLint, and prefer more verbose explanations for unfamiliar or less obvious flaws.",Aspen K.

We observed that participants frequently posed requests to cast a net around one or several subsets of the data or a set of data attributes. They accomplished this directly and by utilizing existing views in unique ways, including by requesting to copy and pivot a group of views collectively and posing a set of parallel requests on target views expressed in one command. These observed actions depart from multi‐view flexible canvas environments that typically provide interfaces in support of generating one view at a time or actions that operate on one view at a time.

In contrast to standard general purpose dimensionality reduction algorithms, we use energy minimization to preserve properties of the flow in the high‐dimensional space. Once the projection operator is optimized, further high‐dimensional trajectories are projected easily. Our 3D projection maintains a number of useful flow properties, such as critical points and flow maps, and is optimized to match geometric characteristics of the high‐dimensional input, as well as optional user constraints. We apply our method to trajectories traced in the phase spaces of second‐order dynamical systems, including finite‐sized objects in fluids, the circular restricted three‐body problem and a damped double pendulum. We compare the projections with standard visualization techniques, such as PCA, t‐SNE and UMAP, and visualize the dynamical systems with multiple coordinated views interactively, featuring a spatial embedding, projection to subspaces, our dimensionality reduction and a seed point exploration tool.",Nemanja Bartolovic;Markus Gross 0001;Tobias Günther,

However, many assumptions about the efficacy of storytelling in visualization lack empirical evaluation. Contributing to an emerging body of work, we study whether selected techniques commonly used in visual data storytelling influence people's attitudes towards immigration. We compare (a) personal visual narratives designed to generate empathy; (b) structured visual narratives of aggregates of people; and (c) an exploratory visualization without narrative acting as a control condition. We conducted two crowdsourced between‐subject studies comparing the three conditions, each with 300 participants. To assess the differences in attitudes between conditions, we adopted established scales from the social sciences used in the European Social Survey (ESS). Although we found some differences between conditions, the effects on people's attitudes are smaller than we expected.

EuroVis,2020,Fiber Surfaces for many Variables,10.1111/cgf.13983,"AbstractScientific visualization deals with increasingly complex data consisting of multiple fields. Typical disciplines generating multivariate data are fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, geology, bioengineering, and climate research. Quite often, scientists are interested in the relation between some of these variables. A popular visualization technique for a single scalar field is the extraction and rendering of isosurfaces. With this technique, the domain can be split into two parts, i.e. a volume with higher values and one with lower values than the selected isovalue. Fiber surfaces generalize this concept to two or three scalar variables up to now. This article extends the notion further to potentially any finite number of scalar fields. We generalize the fiber surface extraction algorithm of Raith et al. [RBN∗19] from 3 to d dimensions and demonstrate the technique using two examples from geology and climate research. The first application concerns a generic model of a nuclear waste repository and the second one an atmospheric simulation over central Europe.

Our approach can naturally deal with obstacles that should be respected in the final drawing (points of interest, rivers, coastlines) and can prefer grid edges near the real‐world course of a line. This allows our drawings to be combined with existing maps, for example as overlays in map services. We formulate an integer linear program which can be used to solve the problem exactly. We also provide a fast approximation algorithm which greedily calculates shortest paths between node candidates on the underlying octilinear grid graph. Previous work used local search techniques to update node positions until a local optimum was found, but without guaranteeing octilinearity. We can thus calculate nearly optimal metro maps in a fraction of a second even for complex networks, enabling the interactive use of our method in map editors.",Hannah Bast;Patrick Brosi;Sabine Storandt,
EuroVis,2020,Augmenting Node-Link Diagrams with Topographic Attribute Maps,10.1111/cgf.13987,"AbstractWe propose a novel visualization technique for graphs that are attributed with scalar data. In many scenarios, these attributes (e.g., birth date in a family network) provide ambient context information for the graph structure, whose consideration is important for different visual graph analysis tasks. Graph attributes are usually conveyed using different visual representations (e.g., color, size, shape) or by reordering the graph structure according to the attribute domain (e.g., timelines). While visual encodings allow graphs to be arranged in a readable layout, assessing contextual information such as the relative similarities of attributes across the graph is often cumbersome. In contrast, attribute‐based graph reordering serves the comparison task of attributes, but typically strongly impairs the readability of the structural information given by the graph's topology. In this work, we augment force‐directed node‐link diagrams with a continuous ambient representation of the attribute context. This way, we provide a consistent overview of the graph's topological structure as well as its attributes, supporting a wide range of graph‐related analysis tasks. We resort to an intuitive height field metaphor, illustrated by a topographic map rendering using contour lines and suitable color maps. Contour lines visually connect nodes of similar attribute values, and depict their relative arrangement within the global context. Moreover, our contextual representation supports visualizing attribute value ranges associated with graph nodes (e.g., lifespans in a family network) as trajectories routed through this height field. We discuss how user interaction with both the structural and the contextual information fosters exploratory graph analysis tasks. The effectiveness and versatility of our technique is confirmed in a user study and case studies from various application domains.",Reinhold Preiner;Johanna Schmidt;Katharina Krösl;Tobias Schreck;Gabriel Mistelbauer,
EuroVis,2020,Set Streams: Visual Exploration of Dynamic Overlapping Sets,10.1111/cgf.13988,"AbstractIn many applications, membership of set elements changes over time. Since each element can be present in multiple sets, the sets also overlap. As a result, it becomes challenging to visualize the temporal change in set membership of elements across several timesteps while showing individual set intersections. We propose Set Streams, a visualization technique that represents changing set structures on a timeline as branching and merging streams. The streams encode the changing membership of elements with set intersections. A query‐based selection mechanism supports a flexible comparison of selected groups of elements across the temporal evolution. The main timeline view is complemented with additional panels to provide details about the elements. While the proposed visualization is an application‐independent visualization technique for dynamic sets, we demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability through three diverse application examples and expert feedback.",Shivam Agarwal;Fabian Beck 0001,
EuroVis,2020,Quantitative Comparison of Time-Dependent Treemaps,10.1111/cgf.13989,"AbstractRectangular treemaps are often the method of choice to visualize large hierarchical datasets. Nowadays such datasets are available over time, hence there is a need for (a) treemaps that can handle time‐dependent data, and (b) corresponding quality criteria that cover both a treemap's visual quality and its stability over time. In recent years a wide variety of (stable) treemapping algorithms has been proposed, with various advantages and limitations. We aim to provide insights to researchers and practitioners to allow them to make an informed choice when selecting a treemapping algorithm for specific applications and data. To this end, we perform an extensive quantitative evaluation of rectangular treemaps for time‐dependent data. As part of this evaluation we propose a novel classification scheme for time‐dependent datasets. Specifically, we observe that the performance of treemapping algorithms depends on the characteristics of the datasets used. We identify four potential representative features that characterize time‐dependent hierarchical datasets and classify all datasets used in our experiments accordingly. We experimentally test the validity of this classification on more than 2000 datasets, and analyze the relative performance of 14 state‐of‐the‐art rectangular treemapping algorithms across varying features. Finally, we visually summarize our results with respect to both visual quality and stability to aid users in making an informed choice among treemapping algorithms.

EuroVis,2020,PAVED: Pareto Front Visualization for Engineering Design,10.1111/cgf.13990,"AbstractDesign problems in engineering typically involve a large solution space and several potentially conflicting criteria. Selecting a compromise solution is often supported by optimization algorithms that compute hundreds of Pareto‐optimal solutions, thus informing a decision by the engineer. However, the complexity of evaluating and comparing alternatives increases with the number of criteria that need to be considered at the same time. We present a design study on Pareto front visualization to support engineers in applying their expertise and subjective preferences for selection of the most‐preferred solution. We provide a characterization of data and tasks from the parametric design of electric motors. The requirements identified were the basis for our development of PAVED, an interactive parallel coordinates visualization for exploration of multi‐criteria alternatives. We reflect on our user‐centered design process that included iterative refinement with real data in close collaboration with a domain expert as well as a summative evaluation in the field. The results suggest a high usability of our visualization as part of a real‐world engineering design workflow. Our lessons learned can serve as guidance to future visualization developers targeting multi‐criteria optimization problems in engineering design or alternative domains.",Lena Cibulski;Hubert Mitterhofer;Thorsten May;Jörn Kohlhammer,
EuroVis,2020,A Globally Conforming Lattice Structure for 2D Stress Tensor Visualization,10.1111/cgf.13991,"AbstractWe present a visualization technique for 2D stress tensor fields based on the construction of a globally conforming lattice. Conformity ensures that the lattice edges follow the principal stress directions and the aspect ratio of lattice elements represents the stress anisotropy. Since such a lattice structure cannot be space‐filling in general, it is constructed from multiple intersecting lattice beams. Conformity at beam intersections is ensured via a constrained optimization problem, by computing the aspect ratio of elements at intersections so that their edges meet when continued along the principal stress lines. In combination with a coloring scheme that encodes relative stress magnitudes, a global visualization is achieved. By introducing additional constraints on the positional variation of the beam intersections, coherent visualizations are achieved when external loads or material parameters are changed. In a number of experiments using non‐trivial scenarios, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed visualization technique to show the global and local structure of a given stress field.",Junpeng Wang;Jun Wu 0005;Rüdiger Westermann,
EuroVis,2020,Feature Driven Combination of Animated Vector Field Visualizations,10.1111/cgf.13992,"AbstractAnimated visualizations are one of the methods for finding and understanding complex structures of time‐dependent vector fields. Many visualization designs can be used to this end, such as streamlines, vector glyphs, and image‐based techniques. While all such designs can depict any vector field, their effectiveness in highlighting particular field aspects has not been fully explored. To fill this gap, we compare three animated vector field visualization techniques, OLIC, IBFV, and particles, for a critical point detection‐and‐classification task through a user study. Our results show that the effectiveness of the studied techniques depends on the nature of the critical points. We use these results to design a new flow visualization technique that combines all studied techniques in a single view by locally using the most effective technique for the patterns present in the flow data at that location. A second user study shows that our technique is more efficient and less error prone than the three other techniques used individually for the critical point detection task.",María-Jesús Lobo;Alexandru C.

EuroVis,2020,LOCALIS: Locally-adaptive Line Simplification for GPU-based Geographic Vector Data Visualization,10.1111/cgf.13993,"AbstractVisualization of large vector line data is a core task in geographic and cartographic systems. Vector maps are often displayed at different cartographic generalization levels, traditionally by using several discrete levels‐of‐detail (LODs). This limits the generalization levels to a fixed and predefined set of LODs, and generally does not support smooth LOD transitions. However, fast GPUs and novel line rendering techniques can be exploited to integrate dynamic vector map LOD management into GPU‐based algorithms for locally‐adaptive line simplification and real‐time rendering. We propose a new technique that interactively visualizes large line vector datasets at variable LODs. It is based on the Douglas‐Peucker line simplification principle, generating an exhaustive set of line segments whose specific subsets represent the lines at any variable LOD. At run time, an appropriate and view‐dependent error metric supports screen‐space adaptive LOD levels and the display of the correct subset of line segments accordingly. Our implementation shows that we can simplify and display large line datasets interactively. We can successfully apply line style patterns, dynamic LOD selection lenses, and anti‐aliasing techniques to our line rendering.",Alireza Amiraghdam;Alexandra Diehl;Renato Pajarola,

However, the large solution space, uncertain traffic conditions, and varying business preferences impose great challenges on warehouse location selection. Conventional approaches mainly summarize relevant evaluation criteria and compile them into an analysis report to facilitate rapid data absorption but fail to support a comprehensive and joint decision‐making process in warehouse location selection. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to facilitating warehouse location selection. We first visually centralize relevant information of warehouses and adapts a widely‐used methodology to efficiently rank warehouse candidates. We then design a delivering estimation model based on massive logistics trajectories to resolve the uncertainty issue of traffic conditions of warehouses. Based on these techniques, an interactive framework is proposed to generate and explore the candidate warehouses. We conduct a case study and a within‐subject study with baseline systems to assess the efficacy of our system.

Most existing analysis tools lack proper support for examining and resolving the conflicts among the findings in order to consolidate the results of collaborative data analysis. In this paper, we present CoVA, a visual analytics system incorporating conflict detection and resolution for supporting asynchronous collaborative data analysis. By using a declarative visualization language and graph representation for managing insights and insight provenance, CoVA effectively leverages distributed revision control workflow from software engineering to automatically detect and properly resolve conflicts in collaborative analysis results. In addition, CoVA provides an effective visual interface for resolving conflicts as well as combining the analysis results. We conduct a user study to evaluate CoVA for collaborative data analysis.

EuroVis,2020,SeqDynamics: Visual Analytics for Evaluating Online Problem-solving Dynamics,10.1111/cgf.13998,"AbstractProblem‐solving dynamics refers to the process of solving a series of problems over time, from which a student's cognitive skills and non‐cognitive traits and behaviors can be inferred. For example, we can derive a student's learning curve (an indicator of cognitive skill) from the changes in the difficulty level of problems solved, or derive a student's self‐regulation patterns (an example of non‐cognitive traits and behaviors) based on the problem‐solving frequency over time. Few studies provide an integrated overview of both aspects by unfolding the problem‐solving process. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system named SeqDynamics that evaluates students ‘problem‐solving dynamics from both cognitive and non‐cognitive perspectives. The system visualizes the chronological sequence of learners’ problem‐solving behavior through a set of novel visual designs and coordinated contextual views, enabling users to compare and evaluate problem‐solving dynamics on multiple scales.

EuroVis,2020,SEEVis: A Smart Emergency Evacuation Plan Visualization System with Data-Driven Shot Designs,10.1111/cgf.13999,"AbstractDespite the significance of tracking human mobility dynamics in a large‐scale earthquake evacuation for an effective first response and disaster relief, the general understanding of evacuation behaviors remains limited. Numerous individual movement trajectories, disaster damages of civil engineering, associated heterogeneous data attributes, as well as complex urban environment all obscure disaster evacuation analysis. Although visualization methods have demonstrated promising performance in emergency evacuation analysis, they cannot effectively identify and deliver the major features like speed or density, as well as the resulting evacuation events like congestion or turn‐back. In this study, we propose a shot design approach to generate customized and narrative animations to track different evacuation features with different exploration purposes of users. Particularly, an intuitive scene feature graph that identifies the most dominating evacuation events is first constructed based on user‐specific regions or their tracking purposes on a certain feature. An optimal camera route, i.e., a storyboard is then calculated based on the previous user‐specific regions or features. For different evacuation events along this route, we employ the corresponding shot design to reveal the underlying feature evolution and its correlation with the environment. Several case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. The feedback from experts and users with different backgrounds suggests that our approach indeed helps them better embrace a comprehensive understanding of the earthquake evacuation.",Quan Li;Yingjie Liu;Li Chen;Xingchao Yang;Yi Peng;Xiaoru Yuan;M.

While the community has proposed over 30 automatic ordering strategies, we still lack empirical guidance for choosing an appropriate strategy for a given task. In this paper, we first propose a classification of tasks and patterns and analyze which PCP reordering strategies help in detecting them. Based on our classification, we then conduct an empirical user study with 31 participants to evaluate reordering strategies for cluster identification tasks. We particularly measure time, identification quality, and the users’ confidence for two different strategies using both synthetic and real‐world datasets. Our results show that, somewhat unexpectedly, participants tend to focus on dissimilar rather than similar dimension pairs when detecting clusters, and are more confident in their answers. This is especially true when increasing the amount of clutter in the data. As a result of these findings, we propose a new reordering strategy based on the dissimilarity of neighboring dimension pairs.",Michael Blumenschein;Xuan Zhang;David Pomerenke;Daniel A.

EuroVis,2020,Sunspot Plots: Model-based Structure Enhancement for Dense Scatter Plots,10.1111/cgf.14001,"AbstractScatter plots are a powerful and well‐established technique for visualizing the relationships between two variables as a collection of discrete points. However, especially when dealing with large and dense data, scatter plots often exhibit problems such as overplotting, making the data interpretation arduous. Density plots are able to overcome these limitations in highly populated regions, but fail to provide accurate information of individual data points. This is particularly problematic in sparse regions where the density estimate may not provide a good representation of the underlying data. In this paper, we present sunspot plots, a visualization technique that communicates dense data as a continuous data distribution, while preserving the discrete nature of data samples in sparsely populated areas. We furthermore demonstrate the advantages of our approach on typical failure cases of scatter plots within synthetic and real‐world data sets and validate its effectiveness in a user study.",Thomas Trautner;Fabian Bolte;Sergej Stoppel;Stefan Bruckner,

In this paper, we present the v‐plot designer; a technique for authoring custom hybrid charts, combining mirrored bar charts, difference encodings, and violin‐style plots. v‐plots are customizable and enable the simultaneous comparison of data distributions on global, local, and aggregation levels. Our system design is grounded in an expert survey that compares and evaluates 20 common visualization techniques to derive guidelines for the task‐driven selection of appropriate visualizations.

We utilize a spectral sparsification approach to reduce the number of attraction force computations to sublinear in the number of edges for dense graphs.

Infomages are casual visuals of data in which a data chart is embedded into a thematic image such that the content of the image reflects the subject and the designer's interpretation of the data. Creating an effective infomage, however, can require a fair amount of design expertise and is thus out of reach for most people. In order to also afford non‐artists with the means to design convincing infomages, we first study the principled design of existing infomages and identify a set of key chart embedding techniques. Informed by these findings we build a design tool that links web‐scale image search with a set of interactive image processing tools to empower novice users with the ability to design a wide variety of infomages. As the embedding process might introduce some amount of visual distortion of the data our tool also aids users to gauge the amount of this distortion, if any.

Using a large number of streamlines results in dense, cluttered visualizations, often containing redundant information and occluding important regions, whereas using a small number of streamlines could result in missing key features of the flow. Many solutions to select a representative set of streamlines have been proposed by researchers over the past two decades. In this state‐of‐the‐art report, we analyze and classify seed placement and streamline selection (SPSS) techniques used by the scientific flow visualization community.

EuroVis,2019,V-Awake: A Visual Analytics Approach for Correcting Sleep Predictions from Deep Learning Models,10.1111/cgf.13667,"AbstractThe usage of deep learning models for tagging input data has increased over the past years because of their accuracy and high‐performance. A successful application is to score sleep stages. In this scenario, models are trained to predict the sleep stages of individuals. Although their predictive accuracy is high, there are still mis classifications that prevent doctors from properly diagnosing sleep‐related disorders. This paper presents a system that allows users to explore the output of deep learning models in a real‐life scenario to spot and analyze faulty predictions. These can be corrected by users to generate a sequence of sleep stages to be examined by doctors. Our approach addresses a real‐life scenario with absence of ground truth. It differs from others in that our goal is not to improve the model itself, but to correct the predictions it provides. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in identifying faulty predictions and helping users to fix them in the proposed use case.",Humberto S. Garcia Caballero;Michel A.

EuroVis,2019,Optimizing Stepwise Animation in Dynamic Set Diagrams,10.1111/cgf.13668,"AbstractA set diagram represents the membership relation among data elements. It is often visualized as secondary information on top of primary information, such as the spatial positions of elements on maps and charts. Visualizing the temporal evolution of such set diagrams as well as their primary features is quite important; however, conventional approaches have only focused on the temporal behavior of the primary features and do not provide an effective means to highlight notable transitions within the set relationships. This paper presents an approach for generating a stepwise animation between set diagrams by decomposing the entire transition into atomic changes associated with individual data elements. The key idea behind our approach is to optimize the ordering of the atomic changes such that the synthesized animation minimizes unwanted set occlusions by considering their depth ordering and reduces the gaze shift between two consecutive stepwise changes. Experimental results and a user study demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively facilitates the visual identification of the detailed transitions inherent in dynamic set diagrams.",Kazuyo Mizuno;Hsiang-Yun Wu;Shigeo Takahashi;Takeo Igarashi,
EuroVis,2019,Interactive Visualization of Flood and Heavy Rain Simulations,10.1111/cgf.13669,"AbstractIn this paper, we present a real‐time technique to visualize large‐scale adaptive height fields with C ‐continuous surface reconstruction. Grid‐based shallow water simulation is an indispensable tool for interactive flood management applications. Height fields defined on adaptive grids are often the only viable option to store and process the massive simulation data. Their visualization requires the reconstruction of a continuous surface from the spatially discrete simulation data. For regular grids, fast linear and cubic interpolation are commonly used for surface reconstruction. For adaptive grids, however, there exists no higher‐order interpolation technique fast enough for interactive applications.Our proposed technique bridges the gap between fast linear and expensive higher‐order interpolation for adaptive surface reconstruction. During reconstruction, no matter if regular or adaptive, discretization and interpolation artifacts can occur, which domain experts consider misleading and unaesthetic. We take into account boundary conditions to eliminate these artifacts, which include water climbing uphill, diving towards walls, and leaking through thin objects. We apply realistic water shading with visual cues for depth perception and add waves and foam synthesized from the simulation data to emphasize flow directions. The versatility and performance of our technique are demonstrated in various real‐world scenarios. A survey conducted with domain experts of different backgrounds and concerned citizens proves the usefulness and effectiveness of our technique.",Daniel Cornel;Andreas Buttinger-Kreuzhuber;Artem Konev;Zsolt Horváth;Michael Wimmer 0001;R.

EuroVis,2019,Follow The Clicks: Learning and Anticipating Mouse Interactions During Exploratory Data Analysis,10.1111/cgf.13670,"AbstractThe goal of visual analytics is to create a symbiosis between human and computer by leveraging their unique strengths. While this model has demonstrated immense success, we are yet to realize the full potential of such a human‐computer partnership. In a perfect collaborative mixed‐initiative system, the computer must possess skills for learning and anticipating the users' needs. Addressing this gap, we propose a framework for inferring attention from passive observations of the user's click, thereby allowing accurate predictions of future events. We demonstrate this technique with a crime map and found that users' clicks can appear in our prediction set 92% ‐ 97% of the time. Further analysis shows that we can achieve high prediction accuracy typically after three clicks. Altogether, we show that passive observations of interaction data can reveal valuable information that will allow the system to learn and anticipate future events.",Alvitta Ottley;Roman Garnett;Ran Wan,

A flexible high‐speed GPU decoder and raycasting framework mixes and matches GPU kernels performing parallel object‐space and image‐space operations for seamless support, on fat and thin clients, of different exploration use cases, including animation and temporal browsing, dynamic exploration of single frames, and high‐quality snapshots generated from near‐lossless data.

Interpretation of latent spaces is challenging because prior knowledge, sometimes subtle and implicit, is essential to the process. We contribute methods for “latent space cartography”, the process of mapping and comparing meaningful semantic dimensions within latent spaces. We first perform a literature survey of relevant machine learning, natural language processing, and scientific research to distill common tasks and propose a workflow process. Next, we present an integrated visual analysis system for supporting this workflow, enabling users to discover, define, and verify meaningful relationships among data points, encoded within latent space dimensions.

EuroVis,2019,DIVA: Exploration and Validation of Hypothesized Drug-Drug Interactions,10.1111/cgf.13674,"AbstractAdverse reactions caused by drug‐drug interactions are a major public health concern. Currently, adverse reaction signals are detected through a tedious manual process in which drug safety analysts review a large number of reports collected through post‐marketing drug surveillance. While computational techniques in support of this signal analysis are necessary, alone they are not sufficient. In particular, when machine learning techniques are applied to extract candidate signals from reports, the resulting set is (1) too large in size, i.e., exponential to the number of unique drugs and reactions in reports, (2) disconnected from the underlying reports that serve as evidence and context, and (3) ultimately requires human intervention to be validated in the domain context as a true signal warranting action. In this work, we address these challenges though a visual analytics system, DIVA, designed to align with the drug safety analysis workflow by supporting the detection, screening, and verification of candidate drug interaction signals. DTVA's abstractions and encodings are informed by formative interviews with drug safety analysts. DIVA's coordinated visualizations realize a proposed novel augmented interaction data model (AIM) which links signals generated by machine learning techniques with domain‐specific metadata critical for signal analysis. DIVA's alignment with the drug review process allows an analyst to interactively screen for important signals, triage signals for in‐depth investigation, and validate signals by reviewing the underlying reports that serve as evidence. The evaluation of DIVA encompasses case‐studies and interviews by drug analysts at the US Food and Drug Administration ‐ both of which confirm that DIVA indeed is effective in supporting analysts in the critical task of exploring and verifying dangerous drug‐drug interactions.",Tabassum Kakar;Xiao Qin 0003;Elke A.

EuroVis,2019,"CV3: Visual Exploration, Assessment, and Comparison of CVs",10.1111/cgf.13675,"AbstractThe Curriculum Vitae (CV, also referred to as “résumé”) is an established representation of a person's academic and professional history. A typical CV is comprised of multiple sections associated with spatio‐temporal, nominal, hierarchical, and ordinal data. The main task of a recruiter is, given a job application with specific requirements, to compare and assess CVs in order to build a short list of promising candidates to interview. Commonly, this is done by viewing CVs in a side‐by‐side fashion. This becomes challenging when comparing more than two CVs, because the reader is required to switch attention between them. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the CVs are structured similarly, thus making the overview cluttered and significantly slowing down the comparison process. In order to address these challenges, in this paper we propose “CV3”, an interactive exploration environment offering users a new way to explore, assess, and compare multiple CVs, to suggest suitable candidates for specific job requirements. We validate our system by means of domain expert feedback whose results highlight both the efficacy of our approach and its limitations.

The methodology is built on the theoretical premise that designing a VA workflow is an optimization of the cost‐benefit ratio of the processes in the workflow. It makes uses three fundamental measures to group and connect “symptoms”, “causes”, “remedies”, and “side‐effects”, and guide the search for potential solutions to the problems. In terms of requirement analysis and system design, the proposed methodology can enable system designers to explore the decision space in a structured manner.

We present the results of a study where 27 Tableau users answered various analysis questions across 3 datasets. We measure task performance, identify recurring patterns across participants' analyses, and assess variance from task specificity and dataset. We find striking differences between existing assumptions and the collected data. Participants successfully completed a variety of tasks, with over 80% accuracy across focused tasks with measurably correct answers. The observed cadence of analyses is surprisingly slow compared to popular assumptions from the database community. We find significant overlap in analyses across participants, showing that EVA behaviors can be predictable.

To investigate, we performed a between‐subjects laboratory experiment with 94 participants to analyze the effects of visual anchors and strategy cues using a visual analytics system. The decision‐making task was to identify misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions that modified the scenario video (visual anchor) and/or strategy cues provided.

We recruited 24 participants and asked them to identify the mediators in a fictitious dataset using bar charts and scatter plots within our visualization interface. The results showed that the accuracy of their responses as to whether a variable is a mediator significantly decreased when a confounding variable directly influenced the variable being analyzed. Further analysis demonstrated how individual visualization exploration strategies and interfaces might influence reasoning performance.

Based on the results, we form ClustMe by selecting the model that best predicts these human judgments among 7 different state‐of‐the‐art merging techniques (Demp). To quantitatively evaluate ClustMe, we conducted a second study, in which 31 human subjects ranked 435 pairs of scatterplots of real and synthetic data in terms of cluster patterns complexity.

In unsteady vector field analysis, researchers recently directed their attention towards the computation of near‐steady reference frames for vortex extraction, which is a numerically challenging endeavor. In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network to combine two steps of the visualization pipeline in an end‐to‐end manner: the filtering and the feature extraction. We use neural networks for the extraction of a steady reference frame for a given unsteady 2D vector field. By conditioning the neural network to noisy inputs and resampling artifacts, we obtain numerically stabler results than existing optimization‐based approaches. Supervised deep learning typically requires a large amount of training data. Thus, our second contribution is the creation of a vector field benchmark data set, which is generally useful for any local deep learning‐based feature extraction. Based on Vatistas velocity profile, we formulate a parametric vector field mixture model that we parameterize based on numerically‐computed example vector fields in near‐steady reference frames. Given the parametric model, we can efficiently synthesize thousands of vector fields that serve as input to our deep learning architecture.

EuroVis,2019,Towards Glyphs for Uncertain Symmetric Second-Order Tensors,10.1111/cgf.13692,"AbstractMeasured data often incorporates some amount of uncertainty, which is generally modeled as a distribution of possible samples. In this paper, we consider second‐order symmetric tensors with uncertainty. In the 3D case, this means the tensor data consists of 6 coefficients – uncertainty, however, is encoded by 21 coefficients assuming a multivariate Gaussian distribution as model. The high dimension makes the direct visualization of tensor data with uncertainty a difficult problem, which was until now unsolved. The contribution of this paper consists in the design of glyphs for uncertain second‐order symmetric tensors in 2D and 3D. The construction consists of a standard glyph for the mean tensor that is augmented by a scalar field that represents uncertainty. We show that this scalar field and therefore the displayed glyph encode the uncertainty comprehensively, i.e., there exists a bijective map between the glyph and the parameters of the distribution. Our approach can extend several classes of existing glyphs for symmetric tensors to additionally encode uncertainty and therefore provides a possible foundation for further uncertain tensor glyph design. For demonstration, we choose the well‐known superquadric glyphs, and we show that the uncertainty visualization satisfies all their design constraints.",Tim Gerrits;Christian Rössl;Holger Theisel,

Most of these tools are developed for classical data science applications, where a user is supported in analyzing measured or simulated data. But recently, there has also been an increasing interest in visual support for understanding machine learning algorithms and frameworks, especially for deep learning. Many, if not most, of the visualization support for (deep) learning addresses the developer of the learning system and not the end user (data scientist). Here we show on a specific example, namely the development of a matrix calculus algorithm, that supporting visualizations can also greatly benefit the development of algorithms in classical domains like in our case computer algebra. The idea is similar to visually supporting the understanding of learning algorithms, namely provide the developer with an interactive, visual tool that provides insights into the workings and, importantly, also into the failures of the algorithm under development. Developing visualization support for matrix calculus development went similar as the development of more traditional visual support systems for data analysts. First, we had to acquaint ourselves with the problem, its language and challenges by talking to the core developer of the matrix calculus algorithm. Once we understood the challenge, it was fairly easy to develop visual support that streamlined the development of the matrix calculus algorithm significantly.",Joachim Giesen;Julien Klaus;Sören Laue;Ferdinand Schreck,

EuroVis,2019,ChronoCorrelator: Enriching Events with Time Series,10.1111/cgf.13697,"AbstractEvent sequences and time series are widely recorded in many application domains; examples are stock market prices, electronic health records, server operation and performance logs. Common goals for recording are monitoring, root cause analysis and predictive analytics. Current analysis methods generally focus on the exploration of either event sequences or time series. However, deeper insights are gained by combining both. We present a visual analytics approach where users can explore both time series and event data simultaneously, combining visualization, automated methods and human interaction. We enable users to iteratively refine the visualization. Correlations between event sequences and time series can be found by means of an interactive algorithm, which also computes the presence of monotonic effects. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to real world and synthetic data sets.",M. A. M. M. van Dortmont;Stef van den Elzen;Jarke J. van Wijk,
EuroVis,2019,Visual-Interactive Preprocessing of Multivariate Time Series Data,10.1111/cgf.13698,"AbstractPre‐processing is a prerequisite to conduct effective and efficient downstream data analysis. Pre‐processing pipelines often require multiple routines to address data quality challenges and to bring the data into a usable form. For both the construction and the refinement of pre‐processing pipelines, human‐in‐the‐loop approaches are highly beneficial. This particularly applies to multivariate time series, a complex data type with multiple values developing over time. Due to the high specificity of this domain, it has not been subject to in‐depth research in visual analytics. We present a visual‐interactive approach for preprocessing multivariate time series data with the following aspects. Our approach supports analysts to carry out six core analysis tasks related to pre‐processing of multivariate time series. To support these tasks, we identify requirements to baseline toolkits that may help practitioners in their choice. We characterize the space of visualization designs for uncertainty‐aware pre‐processing and justify our decisions. Two usage scenarios demonstrate applicability of our approach, design choices, and uncertainty visualizations for the six analysis tasks. This work is one step towards strengthening the visual analytics support for data pre‐processing in general and for uncertainty‐aware pre‐processing of multivariate time series in particular.",Jürgen Bernard;Marco Hutter 0002;Heiko Reinemuth;Hendrik Pfeifer;Christian Bors;Jörn Kohlhammer,
EuroVis,2019,A Geometric Optimization Approach for the Detection and Segmentation of Multiple Aneurysms,10.1111/cgf.13699,"AbstractWe present a method for detecting and segmenting aneurysms in blood vessels that facilitates the assessment of risks associated with the aneurysms. The detection and analysis of aneurysms is important for medical diagnosis as aneurysms bear the risk of rupture with fatal consequences for the patient. For risk assessment and treatment planning, morphological descriptors, such as the height and width of the aneurysm, are used. Our system enables the fast detection, segmentation and analysis of single and multiple aneurysms. The method proceeds in two stages plus an optional third stage in which the user interacts with the system. First, a set of aneurysm candidate regions is created by segmenting regions of the vessels. Second, the aneurysms are detected by a classification of the candidates. The third stage allows users to adjust and correct the result of the previous stages using a brushing interface. When the segmentation of the aneurysm is complete, the corresponding ostium curves and morphological descriptors are computed and a report including the results of the analysis and renderings of the aneurysms is generated. The novelty of our approach lies in combining an analytic characterization of aneurysms and vessels to generate a list of candidate regions with a classifier trained on data to identify the aneurysms in the candidate list. The candidate generation is modeled as a global combinatorial optimization problem that is based on a local geometric characterization of aneurysms and vessels and can be efficiently solved using a graph cut algorithm. For the aneurysm classification scheme, we identified four suitable features and modeled appropriate training data. An important aspect of our approach is that the resulting system is fast enough to allow for user interaction with the global optimization by specifying additional constraints via a brushing interface.",Kai Lawonn;Monique Meuschke;Ralph Wickenhöfer;Bernhard Preim;Klaus Hildebrandt,

Emerging applications range from statistical analysis on image stacks to complex connectomics visual analysis tools targeted to develop and test hypotheses of brain development and activity. In this work, we focus on neuroenergetics, a field where neuroscientists analyze nanoscale brain morphology and relate energy consumption to glucose storage in form of glycogen granules. In order to facilitate the understanding of neuroenergetic mechanisms, we propose a novel customized pipeline for the visual analysis of nanometric‐level reconstructions based on electron microscopy image data. Our framework supports analysis tasks by combining i) a scalable volume visualization architecture able to selectively render image stacks and corresponding labelled data, ii) a method for highlighting distance‐based energy absorption probabilities in form of glow maps, and iii) a hybrid connectivitybased and absorption‐based interactive layout representation able to support queries for selective analysis of areas of interest and potential activity within the segmented datasets. This working pipeline is currently used in a variety of studies in the neuroenergetics domain. Here, we discuss a test case in which the framework was successfully used by domain scientists for the analysis of aging effects on glycogen metabolism, extracting knowledge from a series of nanoscale brain stacks of rodents somatosensory cortex.",Marco Agus;Corrado Calì;Ali K.

With increasing computational power, it is now possible to generate very long and complex simulations, which are cumbersome to explore using traditional 3D animations of protein movements. Guided by requirements derived from multiple focus groups with protein engineering experts, we designed and developed a novel interactive visual analysis approach for long and crowded MD simulations. In this approach, we link a dynamic 3D focus+context visualization with a 2D chart of time series data to guide the detection and navigation towards important spatio‐temporal events. The 3D visualization renders elements of interest in more detail and increases the temporal resolution dependent on the time series data or the spatial region of interest. In case studies with different MD simulation data sets and research questions, we found that the proposed visual analysis approach facilitates exploratory analysis to generate, confirm, or reject hypotheses about causalities.

EuroVis,2019,Scalable Ray Tracing Using the Distributed FrameBuffer,10.1111/cgf.13702,"AbstractImage‐ and data‐parallel rendering across multiple nodes on high‐performance computing systems is widely used in visualization to provide higher frame rates, support large data sets, and render data in situ. Specifically for in situ visualization, reducing bottlenecks incurred by the visualization and compositing is of key concern to reduce the overall simulation runtime. Moreover, prior algorithms have been designed to support either image‐ or data‐parallel rendering and impose restrictions on the data distribution, requiring different implementations for each configuration. In this paper, we introduce the Distributed FrameBuffer, an asynchronous image‐processing framework for multi‐node rendering. We demonstrate that our approach achieves performance superior to the state of the art for common use cases, while providing the flexibility to support a wide range of parallel rendering algorithms and data distributions. By building on this framework, we extend the open‐source ray tracing library OSPRay with a data‐distributed API, enabling its use in data‐distributed and in situ visualization applications.",Will Usher 0001;Ingo Wald;Jefferson Amstutz;Johannes Günther 0001;Carson Brownlee;Valerio Pascucci,

EuroVis,2019,Visual Analysis of Charge Flow Networks for Complex Morphologies,10.1111/cgf.13704,"AbstractIn the field of organic electronics, understanding complex material morphologies and their role in efficient charge transport in solar cells is extremely important. Related processes are studied using the Ising model and Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations resulting in large ensembles of stochastic trajectories. Naive visualization of these trajectories, individually or as a whole, does not lead to new knowledge discovery through exploration. In this paper, we present novel visualization and exploration methods to analyze this complex dynamic data, which provide succinct and meaningful abstractions leading to scientific insights. We propose a morphology abstraction yielding a network composed of material pockets and the interfaces, which serves as backbone for the visualization of the charge diffusion. The trajectory network is created using a novel way of implicitly attracting the trajectories to the skeleton of the morphology relying on a relaxation process. Each individual trajectory is then represented as a connected sequence of nodes in the skeleton. The final network summarizes all of these sequences in a single aggregated network. We apply our method to three different morphologies and demonstrate its suitability for exploring this kind of data.",Sathish Kottravel;Martin Falk;Talha Bin Masood;Mathieu Linares;Ingrid Hotz,

Environment is an important factor in the evolution of galaxies from actively forming stars to quiescent states with little, if any, discernible star formation activity. The gaseous halos of galaxies (the circumgalactic medium, or CGM) play a critical role in their evolution, because the gas necessary to fuel star formation and any gas expelled from widely observed galactic winds must encounter this interface region between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present a taxonomy of tasks typically employed in IGM/CGM studies informed by a survey of astrophysicists at various career levels, and demonstrate how these tasks are facilitated via the use of our visualization software.

EuroVis,2019,Analysis of Decadal Climate Predictions with User-guided Hierarchical Ensemble Clustering,10.1111/cgf.13706,"AbstractIn order to gain probabilistic results, ensemble simulation techniques are increasingly applied in the weather and climate sciences (as well as in various other scientific disciplines). In many cases, however, only mean results or other abstracted quantities such as percentiles are used for further analyses and dissemination of the data. In this work, we aim at a more detailed visualization of the temporal development of the whole ensemble that takes the variability of all single members into account. We propose a visual analytics tool that allows an effective analysis process based on a hierarchical clustering of the time‐dependent scalar fields. The system includes a flow chart that shows the ensemble members' cluster affiliation over time, reflecting the whole cluster hierarchy. The latter one can be dynamically explored using a visualization derived from a dendrogram. As an aid in linking the different views, we have developed an adaptive coloring scheme that takes into account cluster similarity and the containment relationships. Finally, standard visualizations of the involved field data (cluster means, ground truth data, etc.) are also incorporated.

EuroVis,2019,Evaluating image quality measures to assess the impact of lossy data compression applied to climate simulation data,10.1111/cgf.13707,"AbstractApplying lossy data compression to climate model output is an attractive means of reducing the enormous volumes of data generated by climate models. However, because lossy data compression does not exactly preserve the original data, its application to scientific data must be done judiciously. To this end, a collection of measures is being developed to evaluate various aspects of lossy compression quality on climate model output. Given the importance of data visualization to climate scientists interacting with model output, any suite of measures must include a means of assessing whether images generated from the compressed model data are noticeably different from images based on the original model data. Therefore, in this work we conduct a forced‐choice visual evaluation study with climate model data that surveyed more than one hundred participants with domain relevant expertise. In addition to the images created from unaltered climate model data, study images are generated from model data that is subjected to two different types of lossy compression approaches and multiple levels (amounts) of compression. Study participants indicate whether a visual difference can be seen, with respect to the reference image, due to lossy compression effects. We assess the relationship between the perceptual scores from the user study to a number of common (full reference) image quality assessment (IQA) measures, and use statistical models to suggest appropriate measures and thresholds for evaluating lossily compressed climate data. We find the structural similarity index (SSIM) to perform the best, and our findings indicate that the threshold required for climate model data is much higher than previous findings in the literature.",Allison H.

However, existing zoomable UI toolkits such as Pad++ and ZVTM do not provide the backend database support and data‐driven primitives that are necessary for creating large‐scale visualizations. This limitation in existing general‐purpose toolkits has led to many purpose‐built solutions (e.g. Google Maps and ForeCache) that address the issue of scalability but cannot be easily extended to support visualizations beyond their intended data types and usage scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Kyrix to ease the process of creating general and large‐scale web‐based pan/zoom visualizations. Kyrix is an integrated system that provides the developer with a concise and expressive declarative language along with a backend support for performance optimization of large‐scale data. To evaluate the scalability of Kyrix, we conducted a set of benchmarked experiments and show that Kyrix can support high interactivity (with an average latency of 100 ms or below) on pan/zoom visualizations of 100 million data points. We further demonstrate the accessibility of Kyrix through an observational study with 8 developers. Results indicate that developers can quickly learn Kyrix's underlying declarative model to create scalable pan/zoom visualizations. Finally, we provide a gallery of visualizations and show that Kyrix is expressive and flexible in that it can support the developer in creating a wide range of customized visualizations across different application domains and data types.",Wenbo Tao;Xiaoyu Liu;Yedi Wang;Leilani Battle;Çagatay Demiralp;Remco Chang;Michael Stonebraker,

In this paper, we investigate the use of animation to disambiguate different types of aggregation and communicate the meaning of aggregate operations. We present design rationales for animated transitions depicting aggregate operations and present the results of an experiment assessing the impact of these different transitions on identification tasks. We find that judiciously staged animated transitions can improve subjects' accuracy at identifying the aggregation performed, though sometimes with longer response times than with static transitions. Through an analysis of participants' rankings and qualitative responses, we find a consistent preference for animation over static transitions and highlight visual features subjects report relying on to make their judgments. We conclude by extending our animation designs to more complex charts of aggregated data such as box plots and bootstrapped confidence intervals.",Younghoon Kim;Michael Correll;Jeffrey Heer,

We then describe the 3D spatial selection technique Tangible Brush, which gives manual control over the final selection volume. It combines 2D touch with 6‐DOF 3D tangible input to allow users to perform 3D selections in volumetric data. We use touch input to draw a 2D lasso, extruding it to a 3D selection volume based on the motion of a tangible, spatially‐aware tablet. We describe our approach and present its quantitative and qualitative comparison to state‐of‐the‐art structure‐dependent selection.

EuroVis,2019,Route-Aware Edge Bundling for Visualizing Origin-Destination Trails in Urban Traffic,10.1111/cgf.13712,"AbstractOrigin‐destination (OD) trails describe movements across space. Typical visualizations thereof use either straight lines or plot the actual trajectories. To reduce clutter inherent to visualizing large OD datasets, bundling methods can be used. Yet, bundling OD trails in urban traffic data remains challenging. Two specific reasons hereof are the constraints implied by the underlying road network and the difficulty of finding good bundling settings. To cope with these issues, we propose a new approach called Route Aware Edge Bundling (RAEB). To handle road constraints, we first generate a hierarchical model of the road‐and‐trajectory data. Next, we derive optimal bundling parameters, including kernel size and number of iterations, for a user‐selected level of detail of this model, thereby allowing users to explicitly trade off simplification vs accuracy. We demonstrate the added value of RAEB compared to state‐of‐the‐art trail bundling methods on both synthetic and real‐world traffic data for tasks that include the preservation of road network topology and the support of multiscale exploration.",Wei Zeng 0004;Qiaomu Shen;Yuzhe Jiang;Alexandru C.

Social media applications such as Foursquare and Twitter provide access to large‐scale and up‐to‐date dynamic movement data that not only help to understand the social life and pulse of a city but also to maintain and improve urban infrastructure. However, the fast growth rate of this data poses challenges for conventional methods to provide up‐to‐date, flexible analysis. Therefore, planning authorities barely consider it. We present a system and design study to leverage social media data that assist urban and transportation planners to achieve better monitoring and analysis of city dynamics such as visited places and mobility patterns in large metropolitan areas. We conducted a goal‐and‐task analysis with urban planning experts. To address these goals, we designed a system with a scalable data monitoring back‐end and an interactive visual analytics interface. The monitoring component uses intelligent pre‐aggregation to allow dynamic queries in near real‐time. The visual analytics interface leverages unsupervised learning to reveal clusters, routines, and unusual behavior in massive data, allowing to understand patterns in time and space. We evaluated our approach based on a qualitative user study with urban planning experts which demonstrates that intuitive integration of advanced analytical tools with visual interfaces is pivotal in making behavioral city dynamics accessible to practitioners.

Top Tom implements a batch processing pipeline able to run both in near‐real time with time stamped data from streaming sources and on historical data with a temporal dimension in a cold start mode. The resulting output unfolds along three main axes: time, volume and semantic similarity (i.e. topic hierarchical aggregation). To allow the browsing of data in a multiscale fashion and the identification of anomalous behaviors, three visual metaphors were adopted from biological and medical fields to design visualizations, i.e. the flowing of particles in a coherent stream, tomographic cross sectioning and contrast‐like analysis of biological tissues. The platform interface is composed by three main visualizations with coherent and smooth navigation interactions: calendar view, flow view, and temporal cut view. The integration of these three visual models with the multiscale analytic pipeline proposes a novel system for the identification and exploration of topics from unstructured texts.

We present Segmentifier, a novel visual analytics interface that supports an iterative process of refining collections of action sequences into meaningful segments. We present task and data abstractions for clickstream data analysis, leading to a high‐level model built around an iterative view‐refine‐record loop with outcomes of conclude with an answer, export segment for further analysis in downstream tools, or abandon the question for a more fruitful analysis path. Segmentifier supports fast and fluid refinement of segments through tightly coupled visual encoding and interaction with a rich set of views that show evocative derived attributes for segments, sequences, and actions in addition to underlying raw sequences. These views support fast and fluid refinement of segments through filtering and partitioning attribute ranges. Interactive visual queries on custom action sequences are aggregated according to a three‐level hierarchy. Segmentifier features a detailed glyph‐based visual history of the automatically recorded analysis process showing the provenance of each segment as an analysis path of attribute constraints.

We propose a conceptual design for integrated data‐driven reporting that allows for iterative structuring of insights into hierarchies linked to analytic provenance and chosen analysis views. The hierarchies become dynamic and interactive reports where collaborators can review and modify the analysis at a desired level of detail. Our web‐based InsideInsights system provides interaction techniques to annotate states of analytic components, structure annotations, and link them to appropriate presentation views.

It is thus efficiently solvable even for relatively large instances.This positive result and the flexibility offered by constraint programming allow us to study various trade‐offs for overlap removal.

EuroVis,2019,A stable graph layout algorithm for processes,10.1111/cgf.13723,"AbstractProcess mining enables organizations to analyze data about their (business) processes. Visualization is key to gaining insight into these processes and the associated data. Process visualization requires a high‐quality graph layout that intuitively represents the semantics of the process. Process analysis additionally requires interactive filtering to explore the process data and process graph. The ideal process visualization therefore provides a high‐quality, intuitive layout and preserves the mental map of the user during the visual exploration. The current industry standard used for process visualization does not satisfy either of these requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel layout algorithm for processes based on the Sugiyama framework. Our approach consists of novel ranking and order constraint algorithms and a novel crossing minimization algorithm. These algorithms make use of the process data to compute stable, high‐quality layouts. In addition, we use phased animation to further improve mental map preservation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our approach computes layouts of higher quality and preserves the mental map better than the industry standard.

An evaluation of RVS and the combination algorithm compares their speed and quality on 109 graphs against a Barnes‐Hut layout algorithm. The RVS algorithm performs up to 6.1 times faster on the tested graphs while maintaining comparable layout quality. The combination algorithm also performs faster than Barnes‐Hut, but produces layouts that are more symmetric than using RVS alone. Data and code: https://osf.io/nb7m8/",Robert Gove,
EuroVis,2019,State-of-the-Art Report: Visual Computing in Radiation Therapy Planning,10.1111/cgf.13726,"AbstractRadiation therapy (RT) is one of the major curative approaches for cancer. It is a complex and risky treatment approach, which requires precise planning, prior to the administration of the treatment. Visual Computing (VC) is a fundamental component of RT planning, providing solutions in all parts of the process—from imaging to delivery. Despite the significant technological advancements of RT over the last decades, there are still many challenges to address. This survey provides an overview of the compound planning process of RT, and of the ways that VC has supported RT in all its facets. The RT planning process is described to enable a basic understanding in the involved data, users and workflow steps. A systematic categorization and an extensive analysis of existing literature in the joint VC/RT research is presented, covering the entire planning process. The survey concludes with a discussion on lessons learnt, current status, open challenges, and future directions in VC/RT research.",Matthias Schlachter;Renata G. Raidou;Ludvig P.

EuroVis,2019,"Tasks, Techniques, and Tools for Genomic Data Visualization",10.1111/cgf.13727,"AbstractGenomic data visualization is essential for interpretation and hypothesis generation as well as a valuable aid in communicating discoveries. Visual tools bridge the gap between algorithmic approaches and the cognitive skills of investigators. Addressing this need has become crucial in genomics, as biomedical research is increasingly data‐driven and many studies lack well‐defined hypotheses. A key challenge in data‐driven research is to discover unexpected patterns and to formulate hypotheses in an unbiased manner in vast amounts of genomic and other associated data. Over the past two decades, this has driven the development of numerous data visualization techniques and tools for visualizing genomic data. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose taxonomies for data, visualization, and tasks involved in genomic data visualization. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of published genomic visualization tools in the context of the proposed taxonomies.",Sabrina Nusrat;Theresa Anisja Harbig;Nils Gehlenborg,

Pursuing an effective system‐user integration, in which the system actively helps the user to reach his/her analysis goal has been focus of visualization research for quite some time. However, this problem is still largely unsolved. As a result, users might be overwhelmed by powerful but complex visual analysis systems which also limits their ability to produce insightful results. In this context, guidance is a promising step towards enabling an effective mixed‐initiative collaboration to promote the visual analysis. However, the way how guidance should be put into practice is still to be unravelled. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive literature research and provide an overview of how guidance is tackled by different approaches in visual analysis systems. We distinguish between guidance that is provided by the system to support the user, and guidance that is provided by the user to support the system. By identifying open problems, we highlight promising research directions and point to missing factors that are needed to enable the envisioned human‐computer collaboration, and thus, promote a more effective visual data analysis.",Davide Ceneda;Theresia Gschwandtner;Silvia Miksch,

These challenges include dealing with extremely large volumes of multidimensional data, supporting interactive visual analysis, ensembles exploration and visualization, exploring model sensitivities to inputs, mesoscale ocean features analysis, predictive analytics, heterogeneity and complexity of observational data, representing uncertainty, and many more. Researchers across disciplines collaborate to address such challenges, which led to significant research and development advances in ocean and atmospheric sciences, and also in several relevant areas such as visualization and visual analytics, big data analytics, machine learning and statistics. In this report, we perform an extensive survey of research advances in the visual analysis of ocean and atmospheric datasets. First, we survey the task requirements by conducting interviews with researchers, domain experts, and end users working with these datasets on a spectrum of analytics problems in the domain of ocean and atmospheric sciences. We then discuss existing models and frameworks related to data analysis, sense‐making, and knowledge discovery for visual analytics applications. We categorize the techniques, systems, and tools presented in the literature based on the taxonomies of task requirements, interaction methods, visualization techniques, machine learning and statistical methods, evaluation methods, data types, data dimensions and size, spatial scale and application areas. We then evaluate the task requirements identified based on our interviews with domain experts in the context of categorized research based on our taxonomies, and existing models and frameworks of visual analytics to determine the extent to which they fulfill these task requirements, and identify the gaps in current research.

After a general overview of MLICs capturing and storage, we focus on the main approaches to produce representations usable for visualization and analysis. In this context, we first discuss methods for direct exploration of the raw data. We then summarize approaches that strive to emphasize shape and material details by fusing all acquisitions in a single enhanced image. Subsequently, we focus on approaches that produce relightable images through intermediate representations. This can be done both by fitting various analytic forms of the light transform function, or by locally estimating the parameters of physically plausible models of shape and reflectance and using them for visualization and analysis. We finally review techniques that improve object understanding by using illustrative approaches to enhance relightable models, or by extracting features and derived maps. We also review how these methods are applied in several, main application domains, and what are the available tools to perform MLIC visualization and analysis.

EuroVis,2018,Hierarchical Correlation Clustering in Multiple 2D Scalar Fields,10.1111/cgf.13396,"AbstractSets of multiple scalar fields can be used to model many types of variation in data, such as uncertainty in measurements and simulations or time‐dependent behavior of scalar quantities. Many structural properties of such fields can be explained by dependencies between different points in the scalar field. Although these dependencies can be of arbitrary complexity, correlation, i.e., the linear dependency, already provides significant structural information. Existing methods for correlation analysis are usually limited to positive correlation, handle only local dependencies, or use combinatorial approximations to this continuous problem. We present a new approach for computing and visualizing correlated regions in sets of 2‐dimensional scalar fields. This paper describes the following three main contributions: (i) An algorithm for hierarchical correlation clustering resulting in a dendrogram, (ii) a generalization of topological landscapes for dendrogram visualization, and (iii) a new method for incorporating negative correlation values in the clustering and visualization. All steps are designed to preserve the special properties of correlation coefficients. The results are visualized in two linked views, one showing the cluster hierarchy as 2D landscape and the other providing a spatial context in the scalar field's domain. Different coloring and texturing schemes coupled with interactive selection support an exploratory data analysis.",Tom Liebmann;Gunther H. Weber;Gerik Scheuermann,
EuroVis,2018,Representative Consensus from Limited-Size Ensembles,10.1111/cgf.13397,"AbstractCharacterizing the uncertainty and extracting reliable visual information from ensemble data have been persistent challenges in various disciplines, specifically in simulation sciences. Many ensemble analysis and visualization techniques take a probabilistic approach to this problem with the assumption that the ensemble size is large enough to extract reliable statistical or probabilistic summaries. However, many real‐life ensembles are rather limited in size, with only a handful of members, due to various restrictions such as storage, computational power, or sampling limitations. As a result, probabilistic inference is subject to imprecision and can potentially result in untrustworthy information in the presence of a limited sample‐size ensemble. In this case, a more reliable approach is to fuse the information present in an ensemble with a limited number of members with minimal assumptions. In this paper, we propose a technique to construct a representative consensus that is particularly suited for ensembles of a relatively small size. The proposed technique casts the problem as an ordering problem in which at each point in the domain, the ensemble members are ranked based on the local neighborhood. This local approach allows us to provide shape and irregularity sensitivity. The local order statistics will then be fused to construct a global consensus using a Bayesian approach to ensure spatial coherency of the local information. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique using a synthetic and two real‐life examples.",Mahsa Mirzargar;Ross T. Whitaker,
EuroVis,2018,Time Lattice: A Data Structure for the Interactive Visual Analysis of Large Time Series,10.1111/cgf.13398,"AbstractAdvances in technology coupled with the availability of low‐cost sensors have resulted in the continuous generation of large time series from several sources. In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group‐by's at multiple temporal hierarchies. Effective visual analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP cube‐based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space‐efficient cube data structures allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re‐computed whenever there is new data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice, a memory‐efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise Profiler, a web‐based visualization framework that supports the analysis of noise from cities.

EuroVis,2018,Key Time Steps Selection for Large-Scale Time-Varying Volume Datasets Using an Information-Theoretic Storyboard,10.1111/cgf.13399,"AbstractKey time steps selection is essential for effective and efficient scientific visualization of large‐scale time‐varying datasets. We present a novel approach that can decide the number of most representative time steps while selecting them to minimize the difference in the amount of information from the original data. We use linear interpolation to reconstruct the data of intermediate time steps between selected time steps. We propose an evaluation of selected time steps by computing the difference in the amount of information (called information difference) using variation of information (VI) from information theory, which compares the interpolated time steps against the original data. In the one‐time preprocessing phase, a dynamic programming is applied to extract the subset of time steps that minimize the information difference. In the run‐time phase, a novel chart is used to present the dynamic programming results, which serves as a storyboard of the data to guide the user to select the best time steps very efficiently. We extend our preprocessing approach to a novel out‐of‐core approximate algorithm to achieve optimal I/O cost, which also greatly reduces the in‐core computing time and exhibits a nice trade‐off between computing speed and accuracy. As shown in the experiments, our approximate method outperforms the previous globally optimal DTW approach [TLS12] on out‐of‐core data by significantly improving the running time while keeping similar qualities, and is our major contribution.",Bo Zhou;Yi-Jen Chiang,

We introduce ChangeCatcher, a prototype tool to help people find and understand changes in a visualization workbook, specifically, a Tableau workbook. Our design is based on interviews we conducted with experts to investigate user needs and practices around version comparison.

EuroVis,2018,Towards Easy Comparison of Local Businesses Using Online Reviews,10.1111/cgf.13401,"AbstractWith the rapid development of e‐commerce, there is an increasing number of online review websites, such as Yelp, to help customers make better purchase decisions. Viewing online reviews, including the rating score and text comments by other customers, and conducting a comparison between different businesses are the key to making an optimal decision. However, due to the massive amount of online reviews, the potential difference of user rating standards, and the significant variance of review time, length, details and quality, it is difficult for customers to achieve a quick and comprehensive comparison. In this paper, we present E‐Comp, a carefully‐designed visual analytics system based on online reviews, to help customers compare local businesses at different levels of details. More specifically, intuitive glyphs overlaid on maps are designed for quick candidate selection. Grouped Sankey diagram visualizing the rating difference by common customers is chosen for more reliable comparison of two businesses.

We present Chart Constellations, a system to interactively support a single analyst in the review and analysis of data stories created by other collaborative analysts. Instead of iterating through the individual charts for each data story, the analyst can project, cluster, filter, and connect results from all users in a meta‐visualization approach. Constellations supports deriving summary insights about prior investigations and supports the exploration of new, unexplored regions in the dataset. To evaluate our system, we conduct a user study comparing it against data science notebooks.

EuroVis,2018,Visualizing Expanded Query Results,10.1111/cgf.13403,"AbstractWhen performing queries in web search engines, users often face difficulties choosing appropriate query terms. Search engines therefore usually suggest a list of expanded versions of the user query to disambiguate it or to resolve potential term mismatches. However, it has been shown that users find it difficult to choose an expanded query from such a list. In this paper, we describe the adoption of set‐based text visualization techniques to visualize how query expansions enrich the result space of a given user query and how the result sets relate to each other. Our system uses a linguistic approach to expand queries and topic modeling to extract the most informative terms from the results of these queries. In a user study, we compare a common text list of query expansion suggestions to three set‐based text visualization techniques adopted for visualizing expanded query results – namely, Compact Euler Diagrams, Parallel Tag Clouds, and a List View – to resolve ambiguous queries using interactive query expansion. Our results show that text visualization techniques do not increase retrieval efficiency, precision, or recall. Overall, users rate Parallel Tag Clouds visualizing key terms of the expanded query space lowest. Based on the results, we derive recommendations for visualizations of query expansion results, text visualization techniques in general, and discuss alternative use cases of set‐based text visualization techniques in the context of web search.",Michael Mazurek;Manuela Waldner,
EuroVis,2018,Interactive Visual Exploration of Local Patterns in Large Scatterplot Spaces,10.1111/cgf.13404,"AbstractAnalysts often use visualisation techniques like a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) to explore multivariate datasets. The scatterplots of a SPLOM can help to identify and compare two‐dimensional global patterns. However, local patterns which might only exist within subsets of records are typically much harder to identify and may go unnoticed among larger sets of plots in a SPLOM. This paper explores the notion of local patterns and presents a novel approach to visually select, search for, and compare local patterns in a multivariate dataset. Model‐based and shape‐based pattern descriptors are used to automatically compare local regions in scatterplots to assist in the discovery of similar local patterns. Mechanisms are provided to assess the level of similarity between local patterns and to rank similar patterns effectively. Moreover, a relevance feedback module is used to suggest potentially relevant local patterns to the user. The approach has been implemented in an interactive tool and demonstrated with two real‐world datasets and use cases.

With this paper, we address the need for brushing techniques that are both fast, enabling a fluid interaction in visual data exploration and analysis, and also accurate, i.e., enabling the user to effectively select specific data subsets, even when their geometric delimination is non‐trivial. We present a new solution for a near‐perfect sketch‐based brushing technique, where we exploit a convolutional neural network (CNN) for estimating the intended data selection from a fast and simple click‐and‐drag interaction and from the data distribution in the visualization. Our key contributions include a drastically reduced error rate—now below 3%, i.e., less than half of the so far best accuracy—and an extension to a larger variety of selected data subsets, going beyond previous limitations due to linear estimation models.",Chaoran Fan;Helwig Hauser,
EuroVis,2018,Towards User-Centered Active Learning Algorithms,10.1111/cgf.13406,"AbstractThe labeling of data sets is a time‐consuming task, which is, however, an important prerequisite for machine learning and visual analytics. Visual‐interactive labeling (VIAL) provides users an active role in the process of labeling, with the goal to combine the potentials of humans and machines to make labeling more efficient. Recent experiments showed that users apply different strategies when selecting instances for labeling with visual‐interactive interfaces. In this paper, we contribute a systematic quantitative analysis of such user strategies. We identify computational building blocks of user strategies, formalize them, and investigate their potentials for different machine learning tasks in systematic experiments. The core insights of our experiments are as follows. First, we identified that particular user strategies can be used to considerably mitigate the bootstrap (cold start) problem in early labeling phases. Second, we observed that they have the potential to outperform existing active learning strategies in later phases. Third, we analyzed the identified core building blocks, which can serve as the basis for novel selection strategies. Overall, we observed that data‐based user strategies (clusters, dense areas) work considerably well in early phases, while model‐based user strategies (e.g., class separation) perform better during later phases. The insights gained from this work can be applied to develop novel active learning approaches as well as to better guide users in visual interactive labeling.",Jürgen Bernard;Matthias Zeppelzauer;Markus Lehmann;Martin Müller;Michael Sedlmair,
EuroVis,2018,Exploring the Visualization Design Space with Repertory Grids,10.1111/cgf.13407,"AbstractThere is an ongoing discussion in the visualization community about the relevant factors that render a visualization effective, expressive, memorable, aesthetically pleasing, etc. These factors lead to a large design space for visualizations. To explore this design space, qualitative research methods based on observations and interviews are often necessary. We describe an interview method that allows us to systematically acquire and assess important factors from subjective answers by interviewees. To this end, we adopt the repertory grid methodology in the context of visualization. It is based on the personal construct theory: each personality interprets a topic based on a set of personal, basic constructs expressed as contrasts. For the individual interpretation of visualizations, this means that these personal terms can be very different, depending on numerous influences, such as the prior experiences of the interviewed person. We present an interviewing process, visual interface, and qualitative and quantitative analysis procedures that are specifically devised to fit the needs of visualization applications. A showcase interview with 15 typical static information visualizations and 10 participants demonstrates that our approach is effective in identifying common constructs as well as individual differences. In particular, we investigate differences between expert and nonexpert interviewees. Finally, we discuss the differences to other qualitative methods and how the repertory grid can be embedded in existing theoretical frameworks of visualization research for the design process.",Kuno Kurzhals;Daniel Weiskopf,

To better assess these effects and create refined rankings of visual encodings, we conduct an experiment measuring subject performance across task types (e.g., comparing individual versus aggregate values) and data distributions (e.g., with varied cardinalities and entropies). We compare performance across 12 encoding specifications of trivariate data involving 1 categorical and 2 quantitative fields, including the use of x, y, color, size, and spatial subdivision (i.e., faceting). Our results extend existing models of encoding effectiveness and suggest improved approaches for automated design.

EuroVis,2018,The Perception of Graph Properties in Graph Layouts,10.1111/cgf.13410,"AbstractWhen looking at drawings of graphs, questions about graph density, community structures, local clustering and other graph properties may be of critical importance for analysis. While graph layout algorithms have focused on minimizing edge crossing, symmetry, and other such layout properties, there is not much known about how these algorithms relate to a user's ability to perceive graph properties for a given graph layout. In this study, we apply previously established methodologies for perceptual analysis to identify which graph drawing layout will help the user best perceive a particular graph property. We conduct a large scale (n = 588) crowdsourced experiment to investigate whether the perception of two graph properties (graph density and average local clustering coefficient) can be modeled using Weber's law. We study three graph layout algorithms from three representative classes (Force Directed ‐ FD, Circular, and Multi‐Dimensional Scaling ‐ MDS), and the results of this experiment establish the precision of judgment for these graph layouts and properties. Our findings demonstrate that the perception of graph density can be modeled with Weber's law. Furthermore, the perception of the average clustering coefficient can be modeled as an inverse of Weber's law, and the MDS layout showed a significantly different precision of judgment than the FD layout.",Utkarsh Soni;Yafeng Lu;Brett Hansen;Helen C.

EuroVis,2018,Explorative Blood Flow Visualization using Dynamic Line Filtering based on Surface Features,10.1111/cgf.13411,"AbstractRupture risk assessment is a key to devise patient‐specific treatment plans of cerebral aneurysms. To understand and predict the development of aneurysms and other vascular diseases over time, both hemodynamic flow patterns and their effect on the vessel surface need to be analyzed. Flow structures close to the vessel wall often correlate directly with local changes in surface parameters, such as pressure or wall shear stress. Yet, in many existing applications, the analyses of flow and surface features are either somewhat detached from one another or only globally available. Especially for the identification of specific blood flow characteristics that cause local startling parameters on the vessel surface, like elevated pressure values, an interactive analysis tool is missing.The explorative visualization of flow data is challenging due to the complexity of the underlying data. In order to find meaningful structures in the entirety of the flow, the data has to be filtered based on the respective explorative aim. In this paper, we present a combination of visualization, filtering and interaction techniques for explorative analysis of blood flow with a focus on the relation of local surface parameters and underlying flow structures. Coherent bundles of pathlines can be interactively selected based on their relation to features of the vessel wall and further refined based on their own hemodynamic features. This allows the user to interactively select and explore flow structures locally affecting a certain region on the vessel wall and therefore to understand the cause and effect relationship between these entities. Additionally, multiple selected flow structures can be compared with respect to their quantitative parameters, such as flow speed. We confirmed the usefulness of our approach by conducting an informal interview with two expert neuroradiologists and an expert in flow simulation. In addition, we recorded several insights the neuroradiologists were able to gain with the help of our tool.",Benjamin Behrendt;Philipp Berg;Oliver Beuing;Bernhard Preim;Sylvia Saalfeld,

Eccentric flow jets are linked to various diseases like aneurysms. Cardiac 4D PC‐MRI data provide spatio‐temporally resolved blood flow information for the whole cardiac cycle. In this work, we establish a time‐dependent visualization and quantification of flow jets. For this purpose, equidistant measuring planes are automatically placed along the vessel's centerline. The flow jet position and region with highest velocities are extracted for every plane in each time step. This is done during pre‐processing and without user‐defined parameters. We visualize the main flow jet as geometric tube. High‐velocity areas are depicted as a net around this tube. Both geometries are time‐dependent and can be animated. Quantitative values are provided during cross‐sectional measuring plane‐based evaluation. Moreover, we offer a plot visualization as summary of flow jet characteristics for the selected plane. Our physiologically plausible results are in accordance with medical findings. Our clinical collaborators appreciate the possibility to view the flow jet in the whole vessel at once, which normally requires repeated pathline filtering due to varying velocities along the vessel course.

EuroVis,2018,Bladder Runner: Visual Analytics for the Exploration of RT-Induced Bladder Toxicity in a Cohort Study,10.1111/cgf.13413,"AbstractWe present the Bladder Runner, a novel tool to enable detailed visual exploration and analysis of the impact of bladder shape variation on the accuracy of dose delivery, during the course of prostate cancer radiotherapy (RT). Our tool enables the investigation of individual patients and cohorts through the entire treatment process, and it can give indications of RT‐induced complications for the patient. In prostate cancer RT treatment, despite the design of an initial plan prior to dose administration, bladder toxicity remains very common. The main reason is that the dose is delivered in multiple fractions over a period of weeks, during which, the anatomical variation of the bladder – due to differences in urinary filling – causes deviations between planned and delivered doses. Clinical researchers want to correlate bladder shape variations to dose deviations and toxicity risk through cohort studies, to understand which specific bladder shape characteristics are more prone to side effects. This is currently done with Dose‐Volume Histograms (DVHs), which provide limited, qualitative insight. The effect of bladder variation on dose delivery and the resulting toxicity cannot be currently examined with the DVHs. To address this need, we designed and implemented the Bladder Runner, which incorporates visualization strategies in a highly interactive environment with multiple linked views. Individual patients can be explored and analyzed through the entire treatment period, while inter‐patient and temporal exploration, analysis and comparison are also supported. We demonstrate the applicability of our presented tool with a usage scenario, employing a dataset of 29 patients followed through the course of the treatment, across 13 time points. We conducted an evaluation with three clinical researchers working on the investigation of RT‐induced bladder toxicity. All participants agreed that Bladder Runner provides better understanding and new opportunities for the exploration and analysis of the involved cohort data.",Renata G.

From an extensive literature study, we find that the existing solutions suffer from at least one of the drawbacks below: (i) loss of interesting structures/outliers due to sampling; (ii) supporting heatmaps only, which provides limited information; and (iii) no notion of real‐world geography semantics (e.g., country, state, city) is captured in the visualization result as well as the underlying index. Therefore, we propose ConcaveCubes, a cluster‐based data cube to support interactive visualization of large‐scale multidimensional urban data. Specifically, we devise an appropriate visualization abstraction and visualization design based on clusters. We propose a novel concave hull construction method to support boundary based cluster map visualization, where real‐world geographical semantics are preserved without any information loss. Instead of calculating the clusters on demand, ConcaveCubes (re)utilizes existing calculation and visualization results to efficiently support different kinds of user interactions. We conduct extensive experiments using real‐world datasets and show the efficiency and effectiveness of ConcaveCubes by comparing with the state‐of‐the‐art cube‐based solutions.",Mingzhao Li 0001;Farhana Murtaza Choudhury;Zhifeng Bao;Hanan Samet;Timos Sellis,
EuroVis,2018,Hypersliceplorer: Interactive visualization of shapes in multiple dimensions,10.1111/cgf.13415,"AbstractIn this paper we present Hypersliceplorer, an algorithm for generating 2D slices of multi‐dimensional shapes defined by a simplical mesh. Often, slices are generated by using a parametric form and then constraining parameters to view the slice. In our case, we developed an algorithm to slice a simplical mesh of any number of dimensions with a two‐dimensional slice. In order to get a global appreciation of the multi‐dimensional object, we show multiple slices by sampling a number of different slicing points and projecting the slices into a single view per dimension pair. These slices are shown in an interactive viewer which can switch between a global view (all slices) and a local view (single slice). We show how this method can be used to study regular polytopes, differences between spaces of polynomials, and multi‐objective optimization surfaces.",Thomas Torsney-Weir;Torsten Möller;Michael Sedlmair;Robert M.

EuroVis,2018,Exploring High-Dimensional Structure via Axis-Aligned Decomposition of Linear Projections,10.1111/cgf.13416,"AbstractTwo‐dimensional embeddings remain the dominant approach to visualize high dimensional data. The choice of embeddings ranges from highly non‐linear ones, which can capture complex relationships but are difficult to interpret quantitatively, to axis‐aligned projections, which are easy to interpret but are limited to bivariate relationships. Linear project can be considered as a compromise between complexity and interpretability, as they allow explicit axes labels, yet provide significantly more degrees of freedom compared to axis‐aligned projections. Nevertheless, interpreting the axes directions, which are often linear combinations of many non‐trivial components, remains difficult. To address this problem we introduce a structure aware decomposition of (multiple) linear projections into sparse sets of axis‐aligned projections, which jointly capture all information of the original linear ones. In particular, we use tools from Dempster‐Shafer theory to formally define how relevant a given axis‐aligned project is to explain the neighborhood relations displayed in some linear projection. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to discover a diverse set of high quality linear projections and show that in practice the information of k linear projections is often jointly encoded in ∼ k axis‐aligned plots. We have integrated these ideas into an interactive visualization system that allows users to jointly browse both linear projections and their axis‐aligned representatives. Using a number of case studies we show how the resulting plots lead to more intuitive visualizations and new insights.",Jayaraman J.

EuroVis,2018,Interactive Analysis of Word Vector Embeddings,10.1111/cgf.13417,"AbstractWord vector embeddings are an emerging tool for natural language processing. They have proven beneficial for a wide variety of language processing tasks. Their utility stems from the ability to encode word relationships within the vector space. Applications range from components in natural language processing systems to tools for linguistic analysis in the study of language and literature. In many of these applications, interpreting embeddings and understanding the encoded grammatical and semantic relations between words is useful, but challenging. Visualization can aid in such interpretation of embeddings. In this paper, we examine the role for visualization in working with word vector embeddings. We provide a literature survey to catalogue the range of tasks where the embeddings are employed across a broad range of applications. Based on this survey, we identify key tasks and their characteristics. Then, we present visual interactive designs that address many of these tasks. The designs integrate into an exploration and analysis environment for embeddings. Finally, we provide example use cases for them and discuss domain user feedback.",Florian Heimerl;Michael Gleicher,
EuroVis,2018,PixelSNE: Pixel-Aligned Stochastic Neighbor Embedding for Efficient 2D Visualization with Screen-Resolution Precision,10.1111/cgf.13418,"AbstractEmbedding and visualizing large‐scale high‐dimensional data in a two‐dimensional space is an important problem, because such visualization can reveal deep insights of complex data. However, most of the existing embedding approaches run on an excessively high precision, even when users want to obtain a brief insight from a visualization of large‐scale datasets, ignoring the fact that in the end, the outputs are embedded onto a fixed‐range pixel‐based screen space. Motivated by this observation and directly considering the properties of screen space in an embedding algorithm, we propose Pixel‐Aligned Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (PixelSNE), a highly efficient screen resolution‐driven 2D embedding method which accelerates Barnes‐Hut tree‐based t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (BH‐SNE), which is known to be a state‐of‐the‐art 2D embedding method. Our experimental results show a significantly faster running time for PixelSNE compared to BH‐SNE for various datasets while maintaining comparable embedding quality.",Minjeong Kim;Minsuk Choi;Sunwoong Lee;Jian Tang 0005;Haesun Park;Jaegul Choo,
EuroVis,2018,Visualizing Multidimensional Data with Order Statistics,10.1111/cgf.13419,"AbstractMultidimensional data sets are common in many domains, and dimensionality reduction methods that determine a lower dimensional embedding are widely used for visualizing such data sets. This paper presents a novel method to project data onto a lower dimensional space by taking into account the order statistics of the individual data points, which are quantified by their depth or centrality in the overall set. Thus, in addition to conveying relative distances in the data, the proposed method also preserves the order statistics, which are often lost or misrepresented by existing visualization methods. The proposed method entails a modification of the optimization objective of conventional multidimensional scaling (MDS) by introducing a term that penalizes discrepancies between centrality structures in the original space and the embedding. We also introduce two strategies for visualizing lower dimensional embeddings of multidimensional data that takes advantage of the coherent representation of centrality provided by the proposed projection method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our visualization with comparisons on different kinds of multidimensional data, including categorical and multimodal, from a variety of domains such as botany and health care.",Mukund Raj;Ross T.

EuroVis,2018,Visualizing the Phase Space of Heterogeneous Inertial Particles in 2D Flows,10.1111/cgf.13420,"AbstractIn many scientific disciplines, the motion of finite‐sized objects in fluid flows plays an important role, such as in brownout engineering, sediment transport, oceanology or meteorology. These finite‐sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high‐dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high‐dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space‐velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size‐dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple steady and unsteady 2D flows.",Irene Baeza Rojo;Markus H. Gross;Tobias Günther,

In general, these features are line structures. The PV operator has been used successfully for a variety of problems, which include finding vortex‐core lines or extremum lines. We present a new generic feature extraction method for multiple 3D vector fields: The Approximate Parallel Vectors (APV) Operator extracts lines where all fields are approximately parallel. The definition of the APV operator is based on the application of PV for two vector fields that are derived from the given set of fields. The APV operator enables the direct visualization of features of vector field ensembles without processing fields individually and without causing visual clutter. We give a theoretical analysis of the APV operator and demonstrate its utility for a number of ensemble data.",Tim Gerrits;Christian Rössl;Holger Theisel,
EuroVis,2018,Core Lines in 3D Second-Order Tensor Fields,10.1111/cgf.13423,"AbstractVortices are important features in vector fields that show a swirling behavior around a common core. The concept of a vortex core line describes the center of this swirling behavior. In this work, we examine the extension of this concept to 3D second‐order tensor fields. Here, a behavior similar to vortices in vector fields can be observed for trajectories of the eigenvectors. Vortex core lines in vector fields were defined by Sujudi and Haimes to be the locations where stream lines are parallel to an eigenvector of the Jacobian. We show that a similar criterion applied to the eigenvector trajectories of a tensor field yields structurally stable lines that we call tensor core lines. We provide a formal definition of these structures and examine their mathematical properties. We also present a numerical algorithm for extracting tensor core lines in piecewise linear tensor fields. We find all intersections of tensor core lines with the faces of a dataset using a simple and robust root finding algorithm. Applying this algorithm to tensor fields obtained from structural mechanics simulations shows that it is able to effectively detect and visualize regions of rotational or hyperbolic behavior of eigenvector trajectories.",Timo Oster;Christian Rössl;Holger Theisel,
EuroVis,2018,Track Xplorer: A System for Visual Analysis of Sensor-based Motor Activity Predictions,10.1111/cgf.13424,"AbstractWith the rapid commoditization of wearable sensors, detecting human movements from sensor datasets has become increasingly common over a wide range of applications. To detect activities, data scientists iteratively experiment with different classifiers before deciding which model to deploy. Effective reasoning about and comparison of alternative classifiers are crucial in successful model development. This is, however, inherently difficult in developing classifiers for sensor data, where the intricacy of long temporal sequences, high prediction frequency, and imprecise labeling make standard evaluation methods relatively ineffective and even misleading.We introduce Track Xplorer, an interactive visualization system to query, analyze, and compare the predictions of sensor‐data classifiers. Track Xplorer enables users to interactively explore and compare the results of different classifiers, and assess their accuracy with respect to the ground‐truth labels and video. Through integration with a version control system, Track Xplorer supports tracking of models and their parameters without additional workload on model developers. Track Xplorer also contributes an extensible algebra over track representations to filter, compose, and compare classification outputs, enabling users to reason effectively about classifier performance. We apply Track Xplorer in a collaborative project to develop classifiers to detect movements from multisensor data gathered from Parkinson's disease patients. We demonstrate how Track Xplorer helps identify early on possible systemic data errors, effectively track and compare the results of different classifiers, and reason about and pinpoint the causes of misclassifications.",Marco Cavallo;Çagatay Demiralp,

Depending on the data and tasks, users can modify and create various reconstruction models that are presented and compared in the visualization interface. Our tool enables the exploration of the generated threaded structures and the analysis of the untangled reply‐chains, comparing different models and their agreement. To understand the inner‐workings of the models, we visualize their decision spaces, including all considered candidate relations.

EuroVis,2018,A General Illumination Model for Molecular Visualization,10.1111/cgf.13426,"AbstractSeveral visual representations have been developed over the years to visualize molecular structures, and to enable a better understanding of their underlying chemical processes. Today, the most frequently used atom‐based representations are the Space‐filling, the Solvent Excluded Surface, the Balls‐and‐Sticks, and the Licorice models. While each of these representations has its individual benefits, when applied to large‐scale models spatial arrangements can be difficult to interpret when employing current visualization techniques. In the past it has been shown that global illumination techniques improve the perception of molecular visualizations; unfortunately existing approaches are tailored towards a single visual representation. We propose a general illumination model for molecular visualization that is valid for different representations. With our illumination model, it becomes possible, for the first time, to achieve consistent illumination among all atom‐based molecular representations. The proposed model can be further evaluated in real‐time, as it employs an analytical solution to simulate diffuse light interactions between objects. To be able to derive such a solution for the rather complicated and diverse visual representations, we propose the use of regression analysis together with adapted parameter sampling strategies as well as shape parametrization guided sampling, which are applied to the geometric building blocks of the targeted visual representations. We will discuss the proposed sampling strategies, the derived illumination model, and demonstrate its capabilities when visualizing several dynamic molecules.",Pedro Hermosilla;Pere-Pau Vázquez;Àlvar Vinacua;Timo Ropinski,
EuroVis,2018,Analyzing Residue Surface Proximity to Interpret Molecular Dynamics,10.1111/cgf.13427,"AbstractThe surface of a molecule holds important information about the interaction behavior with other molecules. In dynamic folding or docking processes, residues of amino acids with different properties change their position within the molecule over time. The atoms of the residues that are accessible to the solvent can directly contribute to binding interactions, while residues buried within the molecular structure contribute to the stability of the molecule. Understanding patterns and causality of structural changes is important for experts in the pharmaceutical domain, e.g., in the process of drug design. We apply an iterative computation of the Solvent Accessible Surface in order to extract virtual layers of a molecule. The extraction allows to track the movement of residues in the body of the molecule, with respect to the distance of the residue to the surface or the core during dynamics simulations. We visualize the obtained layer information for the complete time span of the molecular dynamics simulation as a 2D‐map and for individual time‐steps as a 3D‐representation of the molecule. The data acquisition has been implemented alongside with further analysis functionality in a prototypical application, which is available to the public domain.

It purposely omits most spatial information and presents physical information associated to single molecular components and their pairwise interactions through a set of 2D InfoVis tools with coordinated views, suitable interaction, and focus+context techniques to analyze large amounts of data. The system provides a wide range of motifs for elements such as protein secondary structures or hydrogen bond networks, and a set of tools for their interactive inspection, both for a single simulation and for comparing two different simulations.

This novel abstraction map provides means to analyze, smoothly transition between, and interact with many visual representations of the DNA origami structures in an effective way that was not possible before. DNA origami structures are nanoscale objects, which are challenging to model in silico. In our holistic approach we seamlessly combine three‐dimensional realistic shape models, two‐dimensional diagrammatic representations, and ordered alignments in one‐dimensional arrangements, with semantic transitions across many scales. To navigate through this large, two‐dimensional abstraction map we highlight locations that users frequently visit for certain tasks and datasets. Particularly interesting viewpoints can be explicitly saved to optimize the workflow. We have developed DimSUM together with domain scientists specialized in DNA nanotechnology. In the paper we discuss our design decisions for both the visualization and the interaction techniques. We demonstrate two practical use cases in which our approach increases the specialists’ understanding and improves their effectiveness in the analysis.

EuroVis,2018,VirtualDesk: A Comfortable and Efficient Immersive Information Visualization Approach,10.1111/cgf.13430,"Abstract3D representations are potentially useful under many circumstances, but suffer from long known perception and interaction challenges. Current immersive technologies, which combine stereoscopic displays and natural interaction, are being progressively seen as an opportunity to tackle this issue, but new guidelines and studies are still needed, especially regarding information visualization. Many proposed approaches are impractical for actual usage, resulting in user discomfort or requiring too much time or space. In this work, we implement and evaluate an alternative data exploration metaphor where the user remains seated and viewpoint change is only realisable through physical movements. All manipulation is done directly by natural mid‐air gestures, with the data being rendered at arm's reach. The virtual reproduction of the analyst's desk aims to increase immersion and enable tangible interaction with controls and two dimensional associated information. A comparative user study was carried out against a desktop‐based equivalent, exploring a set of 9 perception and interaction tasks based on previous literature and a multidimensional projection use case. We demonstrate that our prototype setup, named VirtualDesk, presents excellent results regarding user comfort and immersion, and performs equally or better in all analytical tasks, while adding minimal or no time overhead and amplifying user subjective perceptions of efficiency and engagement. Results are also contrasted to a previous experiment employing artificial flying navigation, with significant observed improvements.",Jorge A. Wagner Filho;Carla Maria Dal Sasso Freitas;Luciana P.

EuroVis,2018,Maps and Globes in Virtual Reality,10.1111/cgf.13431,"AbstractThis paper explores different ways to render world‐wide geographic maps in virtual reality (VR). We compare: (a) a 3D exocentric globe, where the user's viewpoint is outside the globe; (b) a flat map (rendered to a plane in VR); (c) an egocentric 3D globe, with the viewpoint inside the globe; and (d) a curved map, created by projecting the map onto a section of a sphere which curves around the user. In all four visualisations the geographic centre can be smoothly adjusted with a standard handheld VR controller and the user, through a head‐tracked headset, can physically move around the visualisation. For distance comparison exocentric globe is more accurate than egocentric globe and flat map. For area comparison more time is required with exocentric and egocentric globes than with flat and curved maps. For direction estimation, the exocentric globe is more accurate and faster than the other visual presentations. Our study participants had a weak preference for the exocentric globe. Generally the curved map had benefits over the flat map. In almost all cases the egocentric globe was found to be the least effective visualisation. Overall, our results provide support for the use of exocentric globes for geographic visualisation in mixed‐reality.",Yalong Yang 0001;Bernhard Jenny;Tim Dwyer;Kim Marriott;Haohui Chen;Maxime Cordeil,

In this paper, we have proposed a system for creating these physical models using an affordable 3D printer in order to make the creation of these models more widely accessible. Our system retrieves GIS relevant to creating a physical model of a geospatial region and then addresses the two major limitations of affordable 3D printers, namely the limited number of materials and available printing volume. This is accomplished by separating features into distinct extruded layers and splitting large models into smaller pieces, allowing us to employ different methods for the visualization of different geospatial features, like vegetation and residential areas, in a 3D printing context.

EuroVis,2018,CFGExplorer: Designing a Visual Control Flow Analytics System around Basic Program Analysis Operations,10.1111/cgf.13433,"AbstractTo develop new compilation and optimization techniques, computer scientists frequently Consult program analysis artifacts such as Control flow graphs (CFGs) and traces of executed instructions. A CFG is a directed graph representing possible execution paths in a program. CFGs are commonly visualized as node‐link diagrams while traces are commonly viewed in raw text format. Visualizing and exploring CFGs and traces is challenging because of the complexity and specificity of the operations researchers perform. We present a design study where we collaborate with computer scientists researching dynamic binary analysis and compilation techniques. The research group primarily employs CFGs and traces to reason about and develop new algorithms for program optimization and parallelization. Through questionnaires, interviews, and a year‐long observation, we analyzed their use of visualization, noting that the tasks they perform match common subroutines they employ in their techniques. Based on this task analysis, we designed CFGExplorer, a visual analytics system that supports computer scientists with interactions that are integrated with the program structure. We developed a domain‐specific graph modification to generate graph layouts that reflect program structure. CFGExplorer incorporates structures such as functions and loops, and uses the correspondence between CFGs and traces to support navigation. We further augment the system to highlight the output of program analysis techniques, facilitating exploration at a higher level.

We also build upon prior work to augment the design and implementation of different geological attributes (namely, rock type, porosity, and permeability). More specifically, we propose a new sampling strategy to generate decals for porosity on the geological grid, a hybrid visualization for permeability which combines 2D decals and 3D ellipsoid glyphs, and a perceptually‐based design that allows us to visualize additional attributes (e.g., oil saturation) while avoiding visual interference between layers.

In order to manage investment risk, in‐depth analysis of changing correlations is needed, with both high and low correlations between financial assets (and groups thereof) important to identify. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics framework for the interactive analysis of relations and structures in dynamic, high‐dimensional correlation data. We conduct a series of interviews and review the financial correlation analysis literature to guide our design. Our solution combines concepts from multi‐dimensional scaling, weighted complete graphs and threshold networks to present interactive, animated displays which use proximity as a visual metaphor for correlation and animation stability to encode correlation stability. We devise interaction techniques coupled with context‐sensitive auxiliary views to support the analysis of subsets of correlation networks. As part of our contribution, we also present behaviour profiles to help guide future users of our approach. We evaluate our approach by checking the validity of the layouts produced, presenting a number of analysis stories, and through a user study.

There are situations where diagrams may be hard to understand, for example, when several actions are packed in a certain region of the field or there are just too many actions to be transformed in a clear depiction of the play. The representation of how actions develop through time, in particular, may be hardly achieved on such diagrams. The time, and the relationship among the actions of the players through time, is critical on the depiction of complex plays. In this context, we present a study on how player actions may be clearly depicted on 2D diagrams. The study is focused on Baseball plays, a sport where diagrams are heavily used to summarize the actions of the players. We propose a new and simple approach to represent spatiotemporal information in the form of a timeline.

The BCC lattice is well known to be optimal for sampling isotropically band‐limited signals above the Nyquist limit. However, the Face‐Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has been recently proven to be optimal for low‐rate sampling. The CWB interpolation is a state‐of‐the‐art technique on the BCC lattice, which outperforms, for example, the previously proposed box‐spline interpolation in terms of both efficiency and visual quality.

EuroVis,2018,Spatio-Temporal Contours from Deep Volume Raycasting,10.1111/cgf.13438,"AbstractWe visualize contours for spatio‐temporal processes to indicate where and when non‐continuous changes occur or spatial bounds are encountered. All time steps are comprised densely in one visualization, with contours allowing to efficiently analyze processes in the data even in case of spatial or temporal overlap. Contours are determined on the basis of deep raycasting that collects samples across time and depth along each ray. For each sample along a ray, its closest neighbors from adjacent rays are identified, considering time, depth, and value in the process. Large distances are represented as contours in image space, using color to indicate temporal occurrence. This contour representation can easily be combined with volume rendering‐based techniques, providing both full spatial detail for individual time steps and an outline of the whole time series in one view. Our view‐dependent technique supports efficient progressive computation, and requires no prior assumptions regarding the shape or nature of processes in the data.

EuroVis,2018,Rendering and Extracting Extremal Features in 3D Fields,10.1111/cgf.13439,"AbstractVisualizing and extracting three‐dimensional features is important for many computational science applications, each with their own feature definitions and data types. While some are simple to state and implement (e.g. isosurfaces), others require more complicated mathematics (e.g. multiple derivatives, curvature, eigenvectors, etc.). Correctly implementing mathematical definitions is difficult, so experimenting with new features requires substantial investments. Furthermore, traditional interpolants rarely support the necessary derivatives, and approximations can reduce numerical stability. Our new approach directly translates mathematical notation into practical visualization and feature extraction, with minimal mental and implementation overhead. Using a mathematically expressive domain‐specific language, Diderot, we compute direct volume renderings and particle‐based feature samplings for a range of mathematical features. Non‐expert users can experiment with feature definitions without any exposure to meshes, interpolants, derivative computation, etc. We demonstrate high‐quality results on notoriously difficult features, such as ridges and vortex cores, using working code simple enough to be presented in its entirety.",Gordon L.

EuroVis,2018,SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout,10.1111/cgf.13440,"AbstractConstraints enable flexible graph layout by combining the ease of automatic layout with customizations for a particular domain. However, constraint‐based layout often requires many individual constraints defined over specific nodes and node pairs. In addition to the effort of writing and maintaining a large number of similar constraints, such constraints are specific to the particular graph and thus cannot generalize to other graphs in the same domain. To facilitate the specification of customized and generalizable constraint layouts, we contribute SetCoLa: a domain‐specific language for specifying high‐level constraints relative to properties of the backing data. Users identify node sets based on data or graph properties and apply high‐level constraints within each set. Applying constraints to node sets rather than individual nodes reduces specification effort and facilitates reapplication of customized layouts across distinct graphs. We demonstrate the conciseness, generalizability, and expressiveness of SetCoLa on a series of real‐world examples from ecological networks, biological systems, and social networks.",Jane Hoffswell;Alan Borning;Jeffrey Heer,
EuroVis,2018,Multiscale Visualization and Exploration of Large Bipartite Graphs,10.1111/cgf.13441,"AbstractA bipartite graph is a powerful abstraction for modeling relationships between two collections. Visualizations of bipartite graphs allow users to understand the mutual relationships between the elements in the two collections, e.g., by identifying clusters of similarly connected elements. However, commonly‐used visual representations do not scale for the analysis of large bipartite graphs containing tens of millions of vertices, often resorting to an a‐priori clustering of the sets. To address this issue, we present the Who's‐Active‐On‐What‐Visualization (WAOW‐Vis) that allows for multiscale exploration of a bipartite social‐network without imposing an a‐priori clustering. To this end, we propose to treat a bipartite graph as a high‐dimensional space and we create the WAOW‐Vis adapting the multiscale dimensionality‐reduction technique HSNE. The application of HSNE for bipartite graph requires several modifications that form the contributions of this work. Given the nature of the problem, a set‐based similarity is proposed. For efficient and scalable computations, we use compressed bitmaps to represent sets and we present a novel space partitioning tree to efficiently compute similarities; the Sets Intersection Tree. Finally, we validate WAOW‐Vis on several datasets connecting Twitter‐users and ‐streams in different domains: news, computer science and politics. We show how WAOW‐Vis is particularly effective in identifying hierarchies of communities among social‐media users.",Nicola Pezzotti;Jean-Daniel Fekete;Thomas Höllt;Boudewijn P. F.

EuroVis,2018,Interactive Investigation of Traffic Congestion on Fat-Tree Networks Using TreeScope,10.1111/cgf.13442,"AbstractParallel simulation codes often suffer from performance bottlenecks due to network congestion, leaving millions of dollars of investments underutilized. Given a network topology, it is critical to understand how different applications, job placements, routing schemes, etc., are affected by and contribute to network congestion, especially for large and complex networks. Understanding and optimizing communication on large‐scale networks is an active area of research. Domain experts often use exploratory tools to develop both intuitive and formal metrics for network health and performance. This paper presents TreeScope, an interactive, web‐based visualization tool for exploring network traffic on large‐scale fat‐tree networks. TreeScope encodes the network topology using a tailored matrix‐based representation and provides detailed visualization of all traffic in the network. We report on the design process of TreeScope, which has been received positively by network researchers as well as system administrators. Through case studies of real and simulated data, we demonstrate how TreeScope's visual design and interactive support for complex queries on network traffic can provide experts with new insights into the occurrences and causes of congestion in the network.",Harsh Bhatia;Nikhil Jain;Abhinav Bhatele;Yarden Livnat;Jens Domke;Valerio Pascucci;Peer-Timo Bremer,
EuroVis,2018,Information Visualization Evaluation Using Crowdsourcing,10.1111/cgf.13444,"AbstractVisualization researchers have been increasingly leveraging crowdsourcing approaches to overcome a number of limitations of controlled laboratory experiments, including small participant sample sizes and narrow demographic backgrounds of study participants. However, as a community, we have little understanding on when, where, and how researchers use crowdsourcing approaches for visualization research. In this paper, we review the use of crowdsourcing for evaluation in visualization research. We analyzed 190 crowdsourcing experiments, reported in 82 papers that were published in major visualization conferences and journals between 2006 and 2017. We tagged each experiment along 36 dimensions that we identified for crowdsourcing experiments. We grouped our dimensions into six important aspects: study design &amp; procedure, task type, participants, measures &amp; metrics, quality assurance, and reproducibility. We report on the main findings of our review and discuss challenges and opportunities for improvements in conducting crowdsourcing studies for visualization research.",Rita Borgo;Luana Micallef;Benjamin Bach;Fintan McGee;Bongshin Lee,
EuroVis,2018,A Survey of Flattening-Based Medical Visualization Techniques,10.1111/cgf.13445,"AbstractIn many areas of medicine, visualization research can help with task simplification, abstraction or complexity reduction. A common visualization approach is to facilitate parameterization techniques which flatten a usually 3D object into a 2D plane. Within this state of the art report (STAR), we review such techniques used in medical visualization and investigate how they can be classified with respect to the handled data and the underlying tasks. Many of these techniques are inspired by mesh parameterization algorithms which help to project a triangulation in ℝ3 to a simpler domain in ℝ2. It is often claimed that this makes complex structures easier to understand and compare by humans and machines. Within this STAR we review such flattening techniques which have been developed for the analysis of the following medical entities: the circulation system, the colon, the brain, tumors, and bones. For each of these five application scenarios, we have analyzed the tasks and requirements, and classified the reviewed techniques with respect to a developed coding system. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the future development of flattening techniques in these areas.",Julian Kreiser;Monique Meuschke;Gabriel Mistelbauer;Bernhard Preim;Timo Ropinski,
EuroVis,2018,Quality Metrics for Information Visualization,10.1111/cgf.13446,"AbstractThe visualization community has developed to date many intuitions and understandings of how to judge the quality of views in visualizing data. The computation of a visualization's quality and usefulness ranges from measuring clutter and overlap, up to the existence and perception of specific (visual) patterns. This survey attempts to report, categorize and unify the diverse understandings and aims to establish a common vocabulary that will enable a wide audience to understand their differences and subtleties. For this purpose, we present a commonly applicable quality metric formalization that should detail and relate all constituting parts of a quality metric. We organize our corpus of reviewed research papers along the data types established in the information visualization community: multi‐ and high‐dimensional, relational, sequential, geospatial and text data. For each data type, we select the visualization subdomains in which quality metrics are an active research field and report their findings, reason on the underlying concepts, describe goals and outline the constraints and requirements. One central goal of this survey is to provide guidance on future research opportunities for the field and outline how different visualization communities could benefit from each other by applying or transferring knowledge to their respective subdomain.

The exponentially‐growing body of visualization research based on sports data is a prime indication of the importance and timeliness of this report. Sports data visualization research encompasses the breadth of visualization tasks and goals: exploring the design of new visualization techniques; adapting existing visualizations to a novel domain; and conducting design studies and evaluations in close collaboration with experts, including practitioners, enthusiasts, and journalists. Frequently this research has impact beyond sports in both academia and in industry because it is i) grounded in realistic, highly heterogeneous data, ii) applied to real‐world problems, and iii) designed in close collaboration with domain experts. In this report, we analyze current research contributions through the lens of three categories of sports data: box score data (data containing statistical summaries of a sport event such as a game), tracking data (data about in‐game actions and trajectories), and meta‐data (data about the sport and its participants but not necessarily a given game). We conclude this report with a high‐level discussion of sports visualization research informed by our analysis—identifying critical research gaps and valuable opportunities for the visualization community.

EuroVis,2017,Global Feature Tracking and Similarity Estimation in Time-Dependent Scalar Fields,10.1111/cgf.13163,"AbstractWe present an algorithm for tracking regions in time‐dependent scalar fields that uses global knowledge from all time steps for determining the tracks. The regions are defined using merge trees, thereby representing a hierarchical segmentation of the data in each time step. The similarity of regions of two consecutive time steps is measured using their volumetric overlap and a histogram difference. The main ingredient of our method is a directed acyclic graph that records all relevant similarity information as follows: the regions of all time steps are the nodes of the graph, the edges represent possible short feature tracks between consecutive time steps, and the edge weights are given by the similarity of the connected regions. We compute a feature track as the global solution of a shortest path problem in the graph. We use these results to steer the – to the best of our knowledge – first algorithm for spatio‐temporal feature similarity estimation. Our algorithm works for 2D and 3D time‐dependent scalar fields. We compare our results to previous work, showcase its robustness to noise, and exemplify its utility using several real‐world data sets.",Himangshu Saikia;Tino Weinkauf,

However, tracking graphs are limited to a single level threshold and the graphs may vary substantially even under small changes to the threshold. To examine the evolution of features for varying levels, users have to compare multiple tracking graphs without a direct visual link between them. We propose a novel, interactive, nested graph visualization based on the fact that the tracked superlevel set components for different levels are related to each other through their nesting hierarchy. This approach allows us to set multiple tracking graphs in context to each other and enables users to effectively follow the evolution of components for different levels simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on datasets from finite pointset methods, computational fluid dynamics, and cosmology simulations.",Jonas Lukasczyk;Gunther H.

EuroVis,2017,Computing Contour Trees for 2D Piecewise Polynomial Functions,10.1111/cgf.13165,"AbstractContour trees are extensively used in scalar field analysis. The contour tree is a data structure that tracks the evolution of level set topology in a scalar field. Scalar fields are typically available as samples at vertices of a mesh and are linearly interpolated within each cell of the mesh. A more suitable way of representing scalar fields, especially when a smoother function needs to be modeled, is via higher order interpolants. We propose an algorithm to compute the contour tree for such functions. The algorithm computes a local structure by connecting critical points using a numerically stable monotone path tracing procedure. Such structures are computed for each cell and are stitched together to obtain the contour tree of the function. The algorithm is scalable to higher degree interpolants whereas previous methods were restricted to quadratic or linear interpolants. The algorithm is intrinsically parallelizable and has potential applications to isosurface extraction.",Girijanandan Nucha;Georges-Pierre Bonneau;Stefanie Hahmann;Vijay Natarajan,

While the BCC lattice has been shown to have superior approximation properties for volumetric data when compared to the Cartesian Cubic (CC) lattice, there has been little work in the way of designing wavelet filter banks that respect the geometry of the BCC lattice. Since wavelets have applications in signal de‐noising, compression, and sparse signal reconstruction, these filter banks are an important tool that addresses some of the scalability concerns presented by the BCC lattice. We use these filters in the context of volumetric data compression and reconstruction and qualitatively evaluate our results by rendering images of isosurfaces from compressed data.",Joshua Horacsek;Usman R.

EuroVis,2017,Constructing and Evaluating Visualisation Task Classifications: Process and Considerations,10.1111/cgf.13167,"AbstractCategorising tasks is a common pursuit in the visualisation research community, with a wide variety of taxonomies, typologies, design spaces, and frameworks having been developed over the last three decades. While these classifications are universally purported to be useful in both the design and evaluation processes and in guiding future research, remarkably little attention has been paid to how these frameworks have—and can be—constructed and evaluated. In this paper we review the task classification literature and report on current practices in construction and evaluation. We consider the stages of task classification construction and identify the associated threats to validity arising at each stage and in response to the different methods employed. We provide guidance on suitable validation approaches in order to mitigate these threats. We also consider the appropriateness of evaluation strategies according to the different aspects of the classification which they evaluate. In so doing, we seek to provide guidance for developers of classifications in determining appropriate construction and evaluation strategies when developing a classification, and also for those selecting between competing classifications for use in the design and evaluation processes.",Natalie Kerracher;Jessie Kennedy,
EuroVis,2017,An Empirical Study on the Reliability of Perceiving Correlation Indices using Scatterplots,10.1111/cgf.13168,"AbstractScatterplots have been in use for about two centuries, primarily for observing the relationship between two variables and commonly for supporting correlation analysis. In this paper, we report an empirical study that examines how humans’ perception of correlation using scatterplots relates to the Pearson's product‐moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) – a commonly used statistical measure of correlation. In particular, we study human participants’ estimation of correlation under different conditions, e.g., different PPMCC values, different densities of data points, different levels of symmetry of data enclosures, and different patterns of data distribution. As the participants were instructed to estimate the PPMCC of each stimulus scatterplot, the difference between the estimated and actual PPMCC is referred to as an offset. The results of the study show that varying PPMCC values, symmetry of data enclosure, or data distribution does have an impact on the average offsets, while only large variations in density cause an impact that is statistically significant. This study indicates that humans’ perception of correlation using scatterplots does not correlate with computed PPMCC in a consistent manner. The magnitude of offsets may be affected not only by the difference between individuals, but also by geometric features of data enclosures. It suggests that visualizing scatterplots does not provide adequate support to the task of retrieving their corresponding PPMCC indicators, while the underlying model of humans’ perception of correlation using scatterplots ought to feature other variables in addition to PPMCC. The paper also includes a theoretical discussion on the cost‐benefit of using scatterplots.",Varshita Sher;Karen G. Bemis;Ilaria Liccardi;Min Chen 0001,

In particular, we focused on the impact of three classes of soft knowledge: (i) knowledge about application contexts, (ii) knowledge about the patterns to be observed (i.e., in relation to visualization task), and (iii) knowledge about statistical measures. We mapped these classes into three control variables, and used real‐world time series data to construct stimuli. The results of the study confirmed the positive contribution of each class of knowledge towards the reduction of the potential distortion, while the knowledge about the patterns prevents distortion more effectively than the other two classes.",Natchaya Kijmongkolchai;Alfie Abdul-Rahman;Min Chen 0001,

Such aneurysms bear the risk of rupture, whereas their treatment also carries considerable risks for the patient. Medical researchers emphasize the importance of analyzing the interaction of morphological and hemodynamic information for the patient‐specific rupture risk evaluation and treatment analysis. Tensor data such as the stress inside the aneurysm walls characterizes the interplay between the morphology and blood flow and seems to be an important rupture‐prone criterion. We use different glyph‐based techniques to depict local stress tensors simultaneously and compare their applicability to cerebral aneurysms in a user study. We thus offer medical researchers an effective visual exploration tool to assess the aneurysm rupture risk. We developed a GPU‐based implementation of our techniques with a flexible interactive data exploration mechanism.

EuroVis,2017,Visual Verification of Cancer Staging for Therapy Decision Support,10.1111/cgf.13172,"AbstractIt is generally accepted practice that each cancer patient case should be discussed in a clinical expert meeting, the so‐called tumor board. A central role in finding the best therapy options for patients with solid tumors plays the Tumor, lymph Node, and Metastasis staging (TNM staging). Correctness of TNM staging has a significant impact on the therapy choice and hence on the patient's post‐therapeutic quality of life or even survival. If inconsistencies in the TNM staging occur, possible explanations and solutions must be found based on the complex patient records, which takes the costly time of (multiple) physicians. We propose a more efficient visual analysis component, which supports a physician in verifying the given TNM staging before forwarding it to the tumor board. Our component comprises a Bayesian network model of the TNM staging process. Using information from the patient records and Bayesian inference, the models computes a patient‐specific TNM staging, which is then explored and compared to the given staging by means of a graph‐based visualization. Our component is implemented in a research prototype that supports an understanding of the model computations, allows for a fast identification of important influencing factors, and facilitates a quick detection of differences between two TNM stagings. We evaluated our component with five physicians, each studying 20 cases of laryngeal cancer.",Mario A. Cypko;Jan Wojdziak;Matthaeus Stoehr;Bettina Kirchner;Bernhard Preim;Andreas Dietz;Heinz U.

EuroVis,2017,Overview + Detail Visualization for Ensembles of Diffusion Tensors,10.1111/cgf.13173,"AbstractA Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) group study consists of a collection of volumetric diffusion tensor datasets (i.e., an ensemble) acquired from a group of subjects. The multivariate nature of the diffusion tensor imposes challenges on the analysis and the visualization. These challenges are commonly tackled by reducing the diffusion tensors to scalar‐valued quantities that can be analyzed with common statistical tools. However, reducing tensors to scalars poses the risk of losing intrinsic information about the tensor. Visualization of tensor ensemble data without loss of information is still a largely unsolved problem. In this work, we propose an overview + detail visualization to facilitate the tensor ensemble exploration. We define an ensemble representative tensor and variations in terms of the three intrinsic tensor properties (i.e., scale, shape, and orientation) separately. The ensemble summary information is visually encoded into the newly designed aggregate tensor glyph which, in a spatial layout, functions as the overview. The aggregate tensor glyph guides the analyst to interesting areas that would need further detailed inspection. The detail views reveal the original information that is lost during aggregation. It helps the analyst to further understand the sources of variation and formulate hypotheses. To illustrate the applicability of our prototype, we compare with most relevant previous work through a user study and we present a case study on the analysis of a brain diffusion tensor dataset ensemble from healthy volunteers.",Changgong Zhang;Matthan W.

EuroVis,2017,Visualizing the Uncertainty of Graph-based 2D Segmentation with Min-path Stability,10.1111/cgf.13174,"AbstractThis paper presents a novel approach to visualize the uncertainty in graph‐based segmentations of scalar data. Segmentation of 2D scalar data has wide application in a variety of scientific and medical domains. Typically, a segmentation is presented as a single unambiguous boundary although the solution is often uncertain due to noise or blur in the underlying data as well as imprecision in user input. Our approach provides insight into this uncertainty by computing the “min‐path stability”, a scalar measure analyzing the stability of the segmentation given a set of input constraints. Our approach is efficient, easy to compute, and can be generally applied to either graph cuts or live‐wire (even partial) segmentations. In addition to its general applicability, our new approach to graph cuts uncertainty visualization improves on the time complexity of the current state‐of‐the‐art with an additional fast approximate solution. We also introduce a novel query enabled by our approach which provides users with alternate segmentations by efficiently extracting local minima of the segmentation optimization. Finally, we evaluate our approach and demonstrate its utility on data from scientific and medical applications.",Brian Summa;Julien Tierny;Valerio Pascucci,
EuroVis,2017,Sclow Plots: Visualizing Empty Space,10.1111/cgf.13175,"AbstractScatter plots are mostly used for correlation analysis, but are also a useful tool for understanding the distribution of high‐dimensional point cloud data. An important characteristic of such distributions are clusters, and scatter plots have been used successfully to identify clusters in data. Another characteristic of point cloud data that has received less attention so far are regions that contain no or only very few data points. We show that augmenting scatter plots by projections of flow lines along the gradient vector field of the distance function to the point cloud reveals such empty regions or voids. The augmented scatter plots, that we call sclow plots, enable a much better understanding of the geometry underlying the point cloud than traditional scatter plots, and by that support tasks like dimension inference, detecting outliers, or identifying data points at the interface between clusters. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on synthetic and real world data sets.",Joachim Giesen;Lars Kuehne;P. Lucas,
EuroVis,2017,Interactive Regression Lens for Exploring Scatter Plots,10.1111/cgf.13176,"AbstractData analysis often involves finding models that can explain patterns in data, and reduce possibly large data sets to more compact model‐based representations. In Statistics, many methods are available to compute model information. Among others, regression models are widely used to explain data. However, regression analysis typically searches for the best model based on the global distribution of data. On the other hand, a data set may be partitioned into subsets, each requiring individual models. While automatic data subsetting methods exist, these often require parameters or domain knowledge to work with. We propose a system for visual‐interactive regression analysis for scatter plot data, supporting both global and local regression modeling. We introduce a novel regression lens concept, allowing a user to interactively select a portion of data, on which regression analysis is run in interactive time. The lens gives encompassing visual feedback on the quality of candidate models as it is interactively navigated across the input data. While our regression lens can be used for fully interactive modeling, we also provide user guidance suggesting appropriate models and data subsets, by means of regression quality scores. We show, by means of use cases, that our regression lens is an effective tool for user‐driven regression modeling and supports model understanding.",Lin Shao 0001;Aishwarya Mahajan;Tobias Schreck;Dirk J.

Our goal with 1D slices is to combine the benefits of topological views, that is, screen space efficiency, with those of slices, that is a close resemblance of the underlying function. We compare 1D slices to 2D slices and topological views, first, by looking at their performance with respect to common function analysis tasks. We also demonstrate 3 usage scenarios: the 2D sinc function, neural network regression, and optimization traces.

This model complies with the often ungrammatical structure of verbatim transcripts, relating two entities if they are present in the same sentence within a small distance window. Our tool enables the exploratory analysis of multi‐party conversations using several linked views that reveal thematic and temporal structures in the text. In addition to distant‐reading, we integrated close‐reading views for a text‐level investigation process. Beyond the exploratory and temporal analysis of conversations, NEREx helps users generate and validate hypotheses and perform comparative analyses of multiple conversations.

It also allows to visually identify and contextualize extreme values and outliers from a different perspective. Unfortunately, it is limited to univariate data. For multivariate time series, patterns that exist across several dimensions are much harder or impossible to explore. We propose a modified cycle plot using a distance‐based abstraction (Mahalanobis distance) to reduce multiple dimensions to one overview dimension and retain a representation similar to the original. Utilizing this distance‐based cycle plot in an interactive exploration environment, we enhance the Visual Analytics capacity of cycle plots for multivariate outlier detection. To enable interactive exploration and interpretation of outliers, we employ coordinated multiple views that juxtapose a distance‐based cycle plot with Cleveland's original cycle plots of the underlying dimensions.

EuroVis,2017,Visual Analysis of Confocal Raman Spectroscopy Data using Cascaded Transfer Function Design,10.1111/cgf.13183,"Abstract2D Confocal Raman Microscopy (CRM) data consist of high dimensional per‐pixel spectral data of 1000 bands and allows for complex spectral and spatial‐spectral analysis tasks, i.e., in material discrimination, material thickness, and spatial material distributions. Currently, simple integral methods are commonly applied as visual analysis solutions to CRM data which exhibit restricted discrimination power in various regards.In this paper we present a novel approach for the visual analysis of 2D multispectral CRM data using multi‐variate visualization techniques. Due to the large amount of data and the demand of an explorative approach without a‐priori restriction, our system allows for arbitrary interactive (de)selection of varaibles w/o limitation and an unrestricted online definition/construction of new, combined properties. Our approach integrates CRM specific quantitative measures and handles material‐related features for mixed materials in a quantitative manner. Technically, we realize the online definition/construction of new, combined properties as semi‐automatic, cascaded, 1D and 2D multidimensional transfer functions (MD‐TFs). By interactively incorporating new (raw or derived) properties, the dimensionality of the MD‐TF space grows during the exploration procedure and is virtually unlimited.

EuroVis,2017,Graffinity: Visualizing Connectivity in Large Graphs,10.1111/cgf.13184,"AbstractMultivariate graphs are prolific across many fields, including transportation and neuroscience. A key task in graph analysis is the exploration of connectivity, to, for example, analyze how signals flow through neurons, or to explore how well different cities are connected by flights. While standard node‐link diagrams are helpful in judging connectivity, they do not scale to large networks. Adjacency matrices also do not scale to large networks and are only suitable to judge connectivity of adjacent nodes. A key approach to realize scalable graph visualization are queries: instead of displaying the whole network, only a relevant subset is shown. Query‐based techniques for analyzing connectivity in graphs, however, can also easily suffer from cluttering if the query result is big enough. To remedy this, we introduce techniques that provide an overview of the connectivity and reveal details on demand. We have two main contributions: (1) two novel visualization techniques that work in concert for summarizing graph connectivity; and (2) Graffinity, an open‐source implementation of these visualizations supplemented by detail views to enable a complete analysis workflow. Graffinity was designed in a close collaboration with neuroscientists and is optimized for connectomics data analysis, yet the technique is applicable across domains.

Our proposed interleaved parallel edge splatting technique uses a time‐to‐space mapping and shows the complete dynamic graph in a static visualization. It provides an overview of all data dimensions, allowing for visually detecting time‐varying data patterns; hence, it serves as a starting point for further data exploration. By applying clustering and ordering techniques on the vertices, edge splatting on the links, and a dense time‐to‐space mapping, our approach becomes visually scalable in all three dynamic graph data dimensions. We illustrate the usefulness of our technique by applying it to call graphs and US domestic flight data with several hundred vertices, several thousand edges, and more than a thousand time steps.",Michael Burch;Marcel Hlawatsch;Daniel Weiskopf,

Although t‐SNE is one of the best techniques for visualizing high‐dimensional data as 2D scatterplots, t‐SNE has not been used in the context of classical graph layout. We propose a new graph layout method, tsNET, based on representing a graph with a distance matrix, which together with a modified t‐SNE cost function results in desirable layouts. We evaluate our method by a formal comparison with state‐of‐the‐art methods, both visually and via established quality metrics on a comprehensive benchmark, containing real‐world and synthetic graphs.

EuroVis,2017,Dynamic Visual Abstraction of Soccer Movement,10.1111/cgf.13189,"AbstractTrajectory‐based visualization of coordinated movement data within a bounded area, such as player and ball movement within a soccer pitch, can easily result in visual crossings, overplotting, and clutter. Trajectory abstraction can help to cope with these issues, but it is a challenging problem to select the right level of abstraction (LoA) for a given data set and analysis task. We present a novel dynamic approach that combines trajectory simplification and clustering techniques with the goal to support interpretation and understanding of movement patterns. Our technique provides smooth transitions between different abstraction types that can be computed dynamically and on‐the‐fly. This enables the analyst to effectively navigate and explore the space of possible abstractions in large trajectory data sets. Additionally, we provide a proof of concept for supporting the analyst in determining the LoA semi‐automatically with a recommender system. Our approach is illustrated and evaluated by case studies, quantitative measures, and expert feedback.

EuroVis,2017,Visualization of Delay Uncertainty and its Impact on Train Trip Planning: A Design Study,10.1111/cgf.13190,"AbstractUncertainty about possible train delays has an impact on train trips, as the exact arrival time is unknown during trip planning. Delays can lead to missing a connecting train at the transfer station, or to coming too late to an appointment at the destination. Facing this uncertainty, the traveler may wish to use an earlier train or a different connection arriving well before the appointment. Currently, train trip planning is based on scheduled times of connections between two stations. Information about approximate delays is only available shortly before train departure. Although several visualization approaches can show temporal uncertainty, we are not aware of any visual design specifically supporting trip planning, which can show delay uncertainty and its impact on the connections. We propose and evaluate a visual design which extends train trip planning with delay uncertainty. It shows the scheduled train connections together with their expected train delays as well as their impacts on both the arrival time, and the potential of missing a transfer. The visualization also includes information about alternative connections in case of these critical transfers. In this way the user is able to judge which train connection is suitable for a trip. We conducted a user study with 76 participants to evaluate our design. We compared it to two alternative presentations that are prominent in Germany. The study showed that our design performs comparably well for tasks concerning train schedules. The additional uncertainty display as well as the visualization of alternative connections was appreciated and well understood. The participants were able to estimate when they would likely arrive at their destination despite possible train delays while they were unable to estimate this with existing presentations. The users would prefer to use the new design for their trip planning.",Marcel Wunderlich;Kathrin Ballweg;Georg Fuchs;Tatiana von Landesberger,
EuroVis,2017,Comparative Visual Analysis of Structure-Performance Relations in Complex Bulk-Heterojunction Morphologies,10.1111/cgf.13191,"AbstractThe structure of Bulk‐Heterojunction (BHJ) materials, the main component of organic photovoltaic solar cells, is very complex, and the relationship between structure and performance is still largely an open question. Overall, there is a wide spectrum of fabrication configurations resulting in different BHJ morphologies and correspondingly different performances. Current state‐of‐the‐art methods for assessing the performance of BHJ morphologies are either based on global quantification of morphological features or simply on visual inspection of the morphology based on experimental imaging. This makes finding optimal BHJ structures very challenging. Moreover, finding the optimal fabrication parameters to get an optimal structure is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a visual analysis framework to help answer these questions through comparative visualization and parameter space exploration for local morphology features. With our approach, we enable scientists to explore multivariate correlations between local features and performance indicators of BHJ morphologies. Our framework is built on shape‐based clustering of local cubical regions of the morphology that we call patches. This enables correlating the features of clusters with intuition‐based performance indicators computed from geometrical and topological features of charge paths.",Amal Aboulhassan;Ronell Sicat;Daniel Baum;Olga Wodo;Markus Hadwiger,

While there is a substantial body of work in computer vision around the detection and measurement of symmetry in images, there has been little effort to define and validate meaningful measures of the symmetry of graph drawings. In this paper, we evaluate two algorithms that have been proposed for measuring graph drawing symmetry, comparing their judgments to those of human subjects, and investigating the use of stress as an alternative measure of symmetry. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of these measures, possible ways to improve them, and implications for the design of algorithms that optimize the symmetry in the layout.",Eric Welch;Stephen G.

We contribute an end‐to‐end pipeline which takes a bitmap image as input and returns a visual encoding specification as output. We present a text analysis pipeline which detects text elements in a chart, classifies their role (e.g., chart title, x‐axis label, y‐axis title, etc.), and recovers the text content using optical character recognition. We also train a Convolutional Neural Network for mark type classification. Using the identified text elements and graphical mark type, we can then infer the encoding specification of an input chart image. We evaluate our techniques on three chart corpora: a set of automatically labeled charts generated using Vega, charts from the Quartz news website, and charts extracted from academic papers. We demonstrate accurate automatic inference of text elements, mark types, and chart specifications across a variety of input chart types.",Jorge Poco;Jeffrey Heer,
EuroVis,2017,Finding a Clear Path: Structuring Strategies for Visualization Sequences,10.1111/cgf.13194,"AbstractLittle is known about how people structure sets of visualizations to support sequential viewing. We contribute findings from several studies examining visualization sequencing and reception. In our first study, people made decisions between various possible structures as they ordered a set of related visualizations (consisting of either bar charts or thematic maps) into what they considered the clearest sequence for showing the data. We find that most people structure visualization sequences hierarchically: they create high level groupings based on shared data properties like time period, measure, level of aggregation, and spatial region, then order the views within these groupings. We also observe a tendency for certain types of similarities between views, like a common spatial region or aggregation level, to be seen as more appropriate categories for organizing views in a sequence than others, like a common time period or measure. In a second study, we find that viewers’ perceptions of the quality and intention of different sequences are largely consistent with the perceptions of the users who created them. The understanding of sequence preferences and perceptions that emerges from our studies has implications for the development of visualization authoring tools and sequence recommendations for guided analysis.",Jessica Hullman;Robert Kosara;Heidi Lam,
EuroVis,2017,Visual Narrative Flow: Exploring Factors Shaping Data Visualization Story Reading Experiences,10.1111/cgf.13195,"AbstractMany factors can shape the flow of visual data‐driven stories, and thereby the way readers experience those stories. Through the analysis of 80 existing stories found on popular websites, we systematically investigate and identify seven characteristics of these stories, which we name “flow‐factors,” and we illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of “visual narrative flow.” These flow‐factors are navigation input, level of control, navigation progress, story layout, role of visualization, story progression, and navigation feedback. We also describe a series of studies we conducted, which shed initial light on how different visual narrative flows impact the reading experience. We report on two exploratory studies, in which we gathered reactions and preferences of readers for stepper‐ vs. scroller‐driven flows. We then report on a crowdsourced study with 240 participants, in which we explore the effect of the combination of different flow‐factors on readers’ engagement. Our results indicate that visuals and navigation feedback (e.g., static vs. animated transitions) have an impact on readers’ engagement, while level of control (e.g., discrete vs. continuous) may not.",Sean McKenna;Nathalie Henry Riche;Bongshin Lee;Jeremy Boy;Miriah Meyer,
EuroVis,2017,Adaptable Radial Axes Plots for Improved Multivariate Data Visualization,10.1111/cgf.13196,"AbstractRadial axes plots are multivariate visualization techniques that extend scatterplots in order to represent high‐dimensional data as points on an observable display. Well‐known methods include star coordinates or principal component biplots, which represent data attributes as vectors that define axes, and produce linear dimensionality reduction mappings. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that bridges the gap between star coordinates and principal component biplots, which we denominate “adaptable radial axes plots”. It is based on solving convex optimization problems where users can: (a) update the axis vectors interactively, as in star coordinates, while producing mappings that enable to estimate attribute values optimally through labeled axes, similarly to principal component biplots; (b) use different norms in order to explore additional nonlinear mappings of the data; and (c) include weights and constraints in the optimization problems for sorting the data along one axis. The result is a flexible technique that complements, extends, and enhances current radial methods for data analysis.",Manuel Rubio-Sánchez;Alberto Sánchez 0001;Dirk J. Lehmann,
EuroVis,2017,Linear Discriminative Star Coordinates for Exploring Class and Cluster Separation of High Dimensional Data,10.1111/cgf.13197,"AbstractOne main task for domain experts in analysing their nD data is to detect and interpret class/cluster separations and outliers. In fact, an important question is, which features/dimensions separate classes best or allow a cluster‐based data classification. Common approaches rely on projections from nD to 2D, which comes with some challenges, such as: The space of projection contains an infinite number of items. How to find the right one? The projection approaches suffers from distortions and misleading effects. How to rely to the projected class/cluster separation? The projections involve the complete set of dimensions/features. How to identify irrelevant dimensions? Thus, to address these challenges, we introduce a visual analytics concept for the feature selection based on linear discriminative star coordinates (DSC), which generate optimal cluster separating views in a linear sense for both labeled and unlabeled data. This way the user is able to explore how each dimension contributes to clustering. To support to explore relations between clusters and data dimensions, we provide a set of cluster‐aware interactions allowing to smartly iterate through subspaces of both records and features in a guided manner. We demonstrate our features selection approach for optimal cluster/class separation analysis with a couple of experiments on real‐life benchmark high‐dimensional data sets.",Yunhai Wang;Jingting Li;Feiping Nie 0001;Holger Theisel;Minglun Gong;Dirk J.

EuroVis,2017,Understanding Indirect Causal Relationships in Node-Link Graphs,10.1111/cgf.13198,"AbstractTo find correlations and cause and effect relationships in multivariate data sets is central in many data analysis problems. A common way of representing causal relations among variables is to use node‐link diagrams, where nodes depict variables and edges show relationships between them. When performing a causal analysis, analysts may be biased by the position of collected evidences, especially when they are at the top of a list. This is of crucial importance since finding a root cause or a derived effect, and searching for causal chains of inferences are essential analytic tasks when investigating causal relationships. In this paper, we examine whether sequential ordering influences understanding of indirect causal relationships and whether it improves readability of multi‐attribute causal diagrams. Moreover, we see how people reason to identify a root cause or a derived effect. The results of our design study show that sequential ordering does not play a crucial role when analyzing causal relationships, but many connections from/to a variable and higher strength/certainty values may influence the process of finding a root cause and a derived effect.",Juhee Bae;Tove Helldin;Maria Riveiro 0001,
EuroVis,2017,Minimum-Displacement Overlap Removal for Geo-referenced Data Visualization,10.1111/cgf.13199,"AbstractGiven a set of rectangles embedded in the plane, we consider the problem of adjusting the layout to remove all overlap while preserving the orthogonal order of the rectangles. The objective is to minimize the displacement of the rectangles. We call this problem Minimum-Displacement Overlap Removal (mdor). Our interest in this problem is motivated by the application of displaying metadata of archaeological sites. Because most existing overlap removal algorithms are not designed to minimize displacement while preserving orthogonal order, we present and compare several approaches which are tailored to our particular usecase. We introduce a new overlap removal heuristic which we call reArrange. Although conceptually simple, it is very effective in removing the overlap while keeping the displacement small. Furthermore, we propose an additional procedure to repair the orthogonal order after every iteration, with which we extend both our new heuristic and PRISM, a widely used overlap removal algorithm. We compare the performance of both approaches with and without this order repair method. The experimental results indicate that reArrange is very effective for heterogeneous input data where the overlap is concentrated in few dense regions.",Mereke van Garderen;Barbara Pampel;Arlind Nocaj;Ulrik Brandes,
EuroVis,2017,Generating Tile Maps,10.1111/cgf.13200,"AbstractTile maps are an important tool in thematic cartography with distinct qualities (and limitations) that distinguish them from better‐known techniques such as choropleths, cartograms and symbol maps. Specifically, tile maps display geographic regions as a grid of identical tiles so large regions do not dominate the viewer's attention and small regions are easily seen. Furthermore, complex data such as time series can be shown on each tile in a consistent format, and the grid layout facilitates comparisons across tiles. Whilst a small number of handcrafted tile maps have become popular, the time‐consuming process of creating new tile maps limits their wider use. To address this issue, we present an algorithm that generates a tile map of the specified type (e.g. square, hexagon, triangle) from raw shape data. Since the ‘best’ tile map depends on the specific geography visualized and the task to be performed, the algorithm generates and ranks multiple tile maps and allows the user to choose the most appropriate. The approach is demonstrated on a range of examples using a prototype browser‐based application.",Graham McNeill;Scott A. Hale,

The internal structure of these three‐dimensional eddies and the kinematics with which they move are critical to a full understanding of ocean eddies. In this work, we apply a feature‐based method to track instances of ocean eddies through the time steps of a high‐resolution multi‐decadal regional ocean model and generate a series of eddy paths which reflect the life cycle of individual eddy instances. Based on the computed metadata, several important geometric and physical properties of eddy are computed. Illustrative visualization techniques, including visual effectiveness enhancement, focus+context, and smart visibility, are combined with the extracted volume features to explore eddy characteristics at different levels. An evaluation by domain experts indicates that combining our feature‐based techniques with illustrative visualization techniques provides an insight into the role eddies play in ocean circulation.

One of the difficulties is accurate, fast, and dynamic positioning and navigation to enable scaling over orders of magnitude, far beyond the precision of floating point arithmetic. To this end we propose a method that utilizes a dynamically assigned frame of reference to provide the highest possible numerical precision for all salient objects in a scene graph. This makes it possible to smoothly navigate and interactively render, for example, surface structures on Mars and the Milky Way simultaneously. Our work is based on an analysis of tracking and quantification of the propagation of precision errors through the computer graphics pipeline using interval arithmetic. Furthermore, we identify sources of precision degradation, leading to incorrect object positions in screen‐space and z‐fighting. Our proposed method operates without near and far planes while maintaining high depth precision through the use of floating point depth buffers. By providing interoperability with order‐independent transparency algorithms, direct volume rendering, and stereoscopy, our approach is well suited for scientific visualization.

Because the actual positions of bubbles are uncertain, the spatial distribution of bubbles is described by scalar fields of moments, which can be interpreted as probability density functions. Visualizing these simulation results and comparing them to physical experiments is challenging, because neither the shape nor the distribution of bubbles described by the moments lend themselves to visual interpretation.In this work, we describe a visualization approach that provides explicit instances of the bubble distribution and produces bubble geometry based on local flow properties. To facilitate animation, the instancing of the bubble distribution provides coherence over time by advancing bubbles between time steps and updating the distribution.

EuroVis,2017,Uncertainty Footprint: Visualization of Nonuniform Behavior of Iterative Algorithms Applied to 4D Cell Tracking,10.1111/cgf.13204,"AbstractResearch on microscopy data from developing biological samples usually requires tracking individual cells over time. When cells are three‐dimensionally and densely packed in a time‐dependent scan of volumes, tracking results can become unreliable and uncertain. Not only are cell segmentation results often inaccurate to start with, but it also lacks a simple method to evaluate the tracking outcome. Previous cell tracking methods have been validated against benchmark data from real scans or artificial data, whose ground truth results are established by manual work or simulation. However, the wide variety of real‐world data makes an exhaustive validation impossible. Established cell tracking tools often fail on new data, whose issues are also difficult to diagnose with only manual examinations. Therefore, data‐independent tracking evaluation methods are desired for an explosion of microscopy data with increasing scale and resolution. In this paper, we propose the uncertainty footprint, an uncertainty quantification and visualization technique that examines nonuniformity at local convergence for an iterative evaluation process on a spatial domain supported by partially overlapping bases. We demonstrate that the patterns revealed by the uncertainty footprint indicate data processing quality in two algorithms from a typical cell tracking workflow – cell identification and association. A detailed analysis of the patterns further allows us to diagnose issues and design methods for improvements. A 4D cell tracking workflow equipped with the uncertainty footprint is capable of self diagnosis and correction for a higher accuracy than previous methods whose evaluation is limited by manual examinations.",Y.

Analysts can therefore monitor the progression of the results, steer the analysis algorithms, and make early decisions if the estimates provide a convincing picture. In this article, we describe interface design guidelines for helping users understand progressively updating results and make early decisions based on progressive estimates. To illustrate our ideas, we present a prototype PVA tool called InsightsFeed for exploring Twitter data at scale. As validation, we investigate the tradeoffs of our tool when exploring a Twitter dataset in a user study.

This paper explores visual cues that guide attention to a particular area of a visualization. We developed a visual cue taxonomy distinguishing internal from external cues, designed a web tool based on the taxonomy, and conducted a user study with 24 participants to understand user preferences in choosing visual cues. Participants perceived internal cues (e.g., transparency, brightness, and magnification) as the most useful visual cues and often combined them with other internal or external cues to emphasize areas of focus for their audience. Interviews also revealed that the choice of visual cues depends on not only the chart type, but also the presentation setting, the audience, and the function cues are serving.

EuroVis,2017,CoreFlow: Extracting and Visualizing Branching Patterns from Event Sequences,10.1111/cgf.13208,"AbstractEvent sequence datasets with high event cardinality and long sequences are difficult to visualize and analyze. In particular, it is hard to generate a high level visual summary of paths and volume of flow. Existing approaches of mining and visualizing frequent sequential patterns look promising, but have limitations in terms of scalability, interpretability and utility. We propose CoreFlow, a technique that automatically extracts and visualizes branching patterns in event sequences. CoreFlow constructs a tree by recursively applying a three‐step procedure: rank events, divide sequences into groups, and trim sequences by the chosen event. The resulting tree contains key events as nodes, and links represent aggregated flows between key events. Based on CoreFlow, we have developed an interactive system for event sequence analysis. Our approach can compute branching patterns for millions of events in a few seconds, with improved interpretability of extracted patterns compared to previous work. We also present case studies of using the system in three different domains and discuss success and failure cases of applying CoreFlow to real‐world analytic problems.

In this state of the art report, we aim to improve the understanding of graph and trail bundling via the following main contributions. First, we propose a data‐based taxonomy that organizes bundling methods on the type of data they work on (graphs vs trails, which we refer to as paths). Based on a formal definition of path bundling, we propose a generic framework that describes the typical steps of all bundling algorithms in terms of high‐level operations and show how existing method classes implement these steps. Next, we propose a description of tasks that bundling aims to address. Finally, we provide a wide set of example applications of bundling techniques and relate these to the above‐mentioned taxonomies.

However, while highly ranked projections can be informative, some lower ranked ones could offer important complementary information. Therefore, selection based on ranking may miss projections that are important to provide a global picture of the data. The proposed work fills this gap by presenting the Grassmannian Atlas, a framework that captures the global structures of quality measures in the space of all projections, which enables a systematic exploration of many complementary projections and provides new insights into the properties of existing quality measures.",Shusen Liu 0001;Peer-Timo Bremer;J.

EuroVis,2016,Enhancing Scatterplots with Multi-Dimensional Focal Blur,10.1111/cgf.12877,"AbstractScatterplots directly depict two dimensions of multi‐dimensional data points, discarding all other information. To visualize all data, these plots are extended to scatterplot matrices, which distribute the information of each data point over many plots. Problems arising from the resulting visual complexity are nowadays alleviated by concepts like filtering and focus and context. We present a method based on depth of field that contains both aspects and injects information from all dimensions into each scatterplot. Our approach is a natural generalization of the commonly known focus effects from optics. It is based on a multidimensional focus selection body. Points outside of this body are defocused depending on their distance. Our method allows for a continuous transition from data points in focus, over regions of blurry points providing contextual information, to visually filtered data. Our algorithm supports different focus selection bodies, blur kernels, and point shapes. We present an optimized GPU‐based implementation for interactive exploration and show the usefulness of our approach on several data sets.",Joachim Staib;Sebastian Grottel;Stefan Gumhold,
EuroVis,2016,Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding,10.1111/cgf.12878,"AbstractIn recent years, dimensionality‐reduction techniques have been developed and are widely used for hypothesis generation in Exploratory Data Analysis. However, these techniques are confronted with overcoming the trade‐off between computation time and the quality of the provided dimensionality reduction. In this work, we address this limitation, by introducing Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hierarchical‐SNE). Using a hierarchical representation of the data, we incorporate the well‐known mantra of Overview‐First, Details‐On‐Demand in non‐linear dimensionality reduction. First, the analysis shows an embedding, that reveals only the dominant structures in the data (Overview). Then, by selecting structures that are visible in the overview, the user can filter the data and drill down in the hierarchy. While the user descends into the hierarchy, detailed visualizations of the high‐dimensional structures will lead to new insights. In this paper, we explain how Hierarchical‐SNE scales to the analysis of big datasets. In addition, we show its application potential in the visualization of Deep‐Learning architectures and the analysis of hyperspectral images.",Nicola Pezzotti;Thomas Höllt;Boudewijn P. F.

We present a new visualization concept that enables users to explore such data and, specifically, to learn about important items and features that are unknown or overlooked, based on the items and features that are already known. The visualization consists of two juxtaposed tables: an IF‐Table, showing all items with a selection of features; and an FI‐Table, showing all features with a selection of items. This enables the user to limit the number of visible items and features to those needed for the exploration. The interaction is kept simple: each selection of items and features results in a complete overview of similar and relevant items and features.",Paul van der Corput;Jarke J. van Wijk,

Of these alternative aspects, memorability and recall of visualizations have been recently considered, but other aspects such as enjoyment and engagement are not as well explored. We study the enjoyment of two different visualization methods through a user study. In particular, we describe the results of a three‐phase experiment comparing the enjoyment of two different visualizations of the same relational data: node‐link and node‐link‐group visualizations.

A common way of representing such data are node‐link diagrams as they support analysts in achieving a mental model of the data. However, naïve 3D depictions of complex graphs tend to be visually cluttered, even more than in a 2D layout. This makes graph exploration and data analysis less efficient. This problem can be addressed by edge bundling. We introduce a 3D cluster‐based edge bundling algorithm that is inspired by the force‐directed edge bundling (FDEB) algorithm [HvW09b] and fulfills the requirements to be embedded in an interactive framework for spatial data analysis. It is parallelized and scales with the size of the graph regarding the runtime. Furthermore, it maintains the edge's model and thus supports rendering the graph in different structural styles.

Force‐directed layouts provide a way to highlight related entities by positioning them near to each other Entities are brought closer to each other (forming clusters) by forces applied on nodes and connections between nodes. In many application domains, relationships between entities are not temporally stable, which means that cluster structures and cluster memberships also may vary across time. Our approach merges multiple force‐directed layouts at different time points into a single comprehensive visualization that provides a big picture overview of the most significant clusters within a user‐defined period of time. TimeArcs also supports a range of interactive features, such as allowing users to drill‐down in order to see details about a particular cluster. To highlight the benefits of this technique, we demonstrate its application to various datasets, including the IMDB co‐star network, a dataset showing conflicting evidences within biomedical literature of protein interactions, and collocated popular phrases obtained from political blogs.",Dang Tuan Nhon;N.

EuroVis,2016,Pathfinder: Visual Analysis of Paths in Graphs,10.1111/cgf.12883,"AbstractThe analysis of paths in graphs is highly relevant in many domains. Typically, path‐related tasks are performed in node‐link layouts. Unfortunately, graph layouts often do not scale to the size of many real world networks. Also, many networks are multivariate, i.e., contain rich attribute sets associated with the nodes and edges. These attributes are often critical in judging paths, but directly visualizing attributes in a graph layout exacerbates the scalability problem. In this paper, we present visual analysis solutions dedicated to path‐related tasks in large and highly multivariate graphs. We show that by focusing on paths, we can address the scalability problem of multivariate graph visualization, equipping analysts with a powerful tool to explore large graphs. We introduce Pathfinder, a technique that provides visual methods to query paths, while considering various constraints. The resulting set of paths is visualized in both a ranked list and as a node‐link diagram. For the paths in the list, we display rich attribute data associated with nodes and edges, and the node‐link diagram provides topological context. The paths can be ranked based on topological properties, such as path length or average node degree, and scores derived from attribute data. Pathfinder is designed to scale to graphs with tens of thousands of nodes and edges by employing strategies such as incremental query results. We demonstrate Pathfinder's fitness for use in scenarios with data from a coauthor network and biological pathways.",Christian Partl;Samuel Gratzl;Marc Streit;Anne Mai Wassermann;Hanspeter Pfister;Dieter Schmalstieg;Alexander Lex,
EuroVis,2016,Exploring and Comparing Clusterings of Multivariate Data Sets Using Persistent Homology,10.1111/cgf.12884,"AbstractClustering algorithms support exploratory data analysis by grouping inputs that share similar features. Especially the clustering of unlabelled data is said to be a fiendishly difficult problem, because users not only have to choose a suitable clustering algorithm but also a suitable number of clusters. The known issues of existing clustering validity measures comprise instabilities in the presence of noise and restrictive assumptions about cluster shapes. In addition, they cannot evaluate individual clusters locally. We present a new measure for assessing and comparing different clusterings both on a global and on a local level. Our measure is based on the topological method of persistent homology, which is stable and unbiased towards cluster shapes. Based on our measure, we also describe a new visualization that displays similarities between different clusterings (using a global graph view) and supports their comparison on the individual cluster level (using a local glyph view). We demonstrate how our visualization helps detect different—but equally valid—clusterings of data sets from multiple application domains.",Bastian Rieck;Heike Leitte,

EuroVis,2016,Visualizing the Impact of Geographical Variations on Multivariate Clustering,10.1111/cgf.12886,"AbstractTraditional multivariate clustering approaches are common in many geovisualization applications. These algorithms are used to define geodemographic profiles, ecosystems and various other land use patterns that are based on multivariate measures. Cluster labels are then projected onto a choropleth map to enable analysts to explore spatial dependencies and heterogeneity within the multivariate attributes. However, local variations in the data and choices of clustering parameters can greatly impact the resultant visualization. In this work, we develop a visual analytics framework for exploring and comparing the impact of geographical variations for multivariate clustering. Our framework employs a variety of graphical configurations and summary statistics to explore the spatial extents of clustering. It also allows users to discover patterns that can be concealed by traditional global clustering via several interactive visualization techniques including a novel drag &amp; drop clustering difference view. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework over a demographics dataset containing quick facts about counties in the continental United States and demonstrate the need for analytical tools that can enable users to explore and compare clustering results over varying geographical features and scales.",Yifan Zhang 0007;Wei Luo;Elizabeth A.

Currently the most common approach to generating a visualization is to use software that quickly and automatically produces visualizations based on templates. However, it has recently been suggested that constructing a visualization with tangible tiles may be a more accessible method, especially for people without visualization expertise. There is still much to be learned about the differences between these two visualization authoring practices. To better understand how people author visualizations in these two conditions, we ran a qualitative study comparing the use of software to the use of tangible tiles, for the creation of bar charts. Close observation of authoring activities showed how each of the following varied according to the tool used: 1) sequences of action; 2) distribution of time spent on different aspects of the InfoVis pipeline; 3) pipeline task separation; and 4) freedom to manipulate visual variables. From these observations, we discuss the implications of the variations in activity sequences, noting tool design considerations and pointing to future research questions.",Tiffany Wun;Jennifer Payne;Samuel Huron;Sheelagh Carpendale,

Even though pie charts have been around for over 200 years, our understanding of the perceptual factors used to read data in them is still limited. Data is encoded in pie and donut charts in three ways: arc length, center angle, and segment area. For our first study, we designed variations of pie charts to test the importance of individual encodings for reading accuracy. In our second study, we varied the inner radius of a donut chart from a filled pie to a thin outline to test the impact of removing the central angle. Both studies point to angle being the least important visual cue for both charts, and the donut chart being as accurate as the traditional pie chart.",Drew Skau;Robert Kosara,

Since spatial position is usually already specified in advance, we must rely on other visual channels to convey additional relationships for multivariate analysis. One such relationship is the apparent order present in the data. This paper presents two crowdsourcing empirical studies that focus on the perceptual evaluation of orderability for visual channels, namely Bertin's retinal variables. The first study investigates the perception of order in a sequence of elements encoded with different visual channels. We found evidence that certain visual channels are perceived as more ordered (for example, value) while others are perceived as less ordered (for example, hue) than the measured order present in the data. As a result, certain visual channels are more/less sensitive to disorder. The second study evaluates how visual orderability affects min and max judgements of elements in the sequence. We found that visual channels that tend to be perceived as ordered, improve the accuracy of identifying these values.",David H. S. Chung;Daniel Archambault;Rita Borgo;Darren J. Edwards;Robert S.

Glyphs permit inspecting individual tensor values, but existing tensor glyphs are fully defined only for symmetric tensors. We propose a glyph to visualize asymmetric second‐order two‐dimensional tensors. The glyph includes visual encoding for physically significant attributes of the tensor, including rotation, anisotropic stretching, and isotropic dilation. Our glyph design conserves the symmetry and continuity properties of the underlying tensor, in that transformations of a tensor (such as rotation or negation) correspond to analogous transformations of the glyph.

These models consist of thousands of instances with a comparably smaller number of different types. Our method constitutes a two stage process. In the first step, clipping objects are placed in the scene, creating a cutaway visualization of the model. During this process, a hierarchical list of stacked bars inform the user about the instance visibility distribution of each individual molecular type in the scene. In the second step, the visibility of each molecular type is fine‐tuned through these bars, which at this point act as interactive visibility equalizers. An evaluation of our technique with domain experts confirmed that our equalizer‐based approach for visibility specification is valuable and effective for both, scientific and educational purposes.",Mathieu Le Muzic;Peter Mindek;Johannes Sorger;Ludovic Autin;David S.

In particular, we evaluated viewpoint entropy, which was previously shown to be a good predictor for human viewpoint preference of other, mostly non‐abstract objects. In a second study, we asked 7 experts in molecular biology to find the best viewpoint of the same protein domains and compared their choices with viewpoint entropy.Our results indicate that viewpoint entropy overall is a significant predictor of human viewpoint preference for ribbon representations of protein secondary structure. However, the accuracy depends on the type and composition of the structure: while most participants agree on good viewpoints for structures with mainly beta sheets, viewpoint preference varies considerably for complex arrangements of alpha helices. Finally, experts tend to choose viewpoints of both low and high viewpoint entropy to emphasize different aspects of the respective structure.",Julian Heinrich;Jenny Vuong;Christopher J. Hammang;A.

During the interrupted in situ testing of glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRPs) defects of four types are expected to appear: matrix fracture, fiber/matrix debonding, fiber pull‐out, and fiber fracture. There is a growing demand for the detection and analysis of these defects among the material engineers. In this paper, we present a novel workflow for the detection, classification, and visual analysis of defects in GFRPs using interrupted in situ tensile tests in combination with X‐ray Computed Tomography. The workflow is based on the automatic extraction of defects and fibers. We introduce the automatic Defect Classifier assigning the most suitable type to each defect based on its geometrical features.

However, current state‐of‐the‐art isosurfacing algorithms usually consume large amounts of GPU memory owing to the additional acceleration structures they require. As a result, the continued limitations on available GPU memory mean that they are unable to deal with the larger datasets that are now increasingly becoming prevalent.This paper proposes a new parallel isosurface‐extraction algorithm that exploits the blocked organisation of the parallel threads found in modern many‐core platforms to achieve fast isosurface extraction and reduce the associated memory requirements. This is achieved by optimising thread co‐operation within thread‐blocks and reducing redundant computation; ultimately, an indexed triangular mesh can be produced.Experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm is much faster (up to 10×) than state‐of‐the‐art GPU algorithms and has a much smaller memory footprint, enabling it to handle much larger datasets (up to 64×) on the same GPU.",Baoquan Liu;Gordon Clapworthy;Feng Dong 0005;Enhua Wu,

We first show how to derive a statistical model describing the contour variability, by representing the contours implicitly via signed distance functions and clustering similar functions in a reduced order space. We show that the spatial patterns of the ensemble can then be derived by analytically transforming the boundaries of a confidence interval computed from each cluster into the spatial domain. Furthermore, we introduce a mathematical basis for computing correlations between the occurrences of iso‐contours at different locations. We show that the computation of these correlations can be posed in the reduced order space as an integration problem over a region bounded by four hyper‐planes. To visualize the derived statistical properties we employ a variant of variability plots for streamlines, now including the color coding of probabilities of joint contour occurrences.

EuroVis,2016,Visual Analysis of Tumor Control Models for Prediction of Radiotherapy Response,10.1111/cgf.12899,"AbstractIn radiotherapy, tumors are irradiated with a high dose, while surrounding healthy tissues are spared. To quantify the probability that a tumor is effectively treated with a given dose, statistical models were built and employed in clinical research. These are called tumor control probability (TCP) models. Recently, TCP models started incorporating additional information from imaging modalities. In this way, patient‐specific properties of tumor tissues are included, improving the radiobiological accuracy of models. Yet, the employed imaging modalities are subject to uncertainties with significant impact on the modeling outcome, while the models are sensitive to a number of parameter assumptions. Currently, uncertainty and parameter sensitivity are not incorporated in the analysis, due to time and resource constraints. To this end, we propose a visual tool that enables clinical researchers working on TCP modeling, to explore the information provided by their models, to discover new knowledge and to confirm or generate hypotheses within their data. Our approach incorporates the following four main components: (1) It supports the exploration of uncertainty and its effect on TCP models; (2) It facilitates parameter sensitivity analysis to common assumptions; (3) It enables the identification of inter‐patient response variability; (4) It allows starting the analysis from the desired treatment outcome, to identify treatment strategies that achieve it.

EuroVis,2016,Faceted Views of Varying Emphasis (FaVVEs): a framework for visualising multi-perspective small multiples,10.1111/cgf.12900,"AbstractMany datasets have multiple perspectives – for example space, time and description – and often analysts are required to study these multiple perspectives concurrently. This concurrent analysis becomes difficult when data are grouped and split into small multiples for comparison. A design challenge is thus to provide representations that enable multiple perspectives, split into small multiples, to be viewed simultaneously in ways that neither clutter nor overload. We present a design framework that allows us to do this. We claim that multi‐perspective comparison across small multiples may be possible by superimposing perspectives on one another rather than juxtaposing those perspectives side‐by‐side. This approach defies conventional wisdom and likely results in visual and informational clutter. For this reason we propose designs at three levels of abstraction for each perspective. By flexibly varying the abstraction level, certain perspectives can be brought into, or out of, focus. We evaluate our framework through laboratory‐style user tests. We find that superimposing, rather than juxtaposing, perspective views has little effect on performance of a low‐level comparison task. We reflect on the user study and its design to further identify analysis situations for which our framework may be desirable. Although the user study findings were insufficiently discriminating, we believe our framework opens up a new design space for multi‐perspective visual analysis.",Roger Beecham;Chris Rooney;S.

Additionally, we introduce two novel brushing techniques: the percentile brush and the Mahalanobis brush. Both use the underlying data to support statistically meaningful interactions with the data.

Bringing this design pattern to tablet computers is challenging due to their small display size and the absence of keyboard and mouse input.

Recent advances leverage reactive semantics to support declarative design and avoid the “spaghetti code” of imperative event handlers. While reactive programming improves many aspects of development, textual specifications still fail to convey the complex runtime dynamics. In response, we contribute a set of visual debugging techniques to reveal the runtime behavior of reactive visualizations. A timeline view records input events and dynamic variable updates, allowing designers to replay and inspect the propagation of values step‐by‐step. On‐demand annotations overlay the output visualization to expose relevant state and scale mappings in‐situ. Dynamic tables visualize how backing datasets change over time.

Consequently, data anonymization is of critical importance if this data is to be made available to consumers. However, anonymization commonly reduces the utility of information available. Working with privacy experts, we designed GSUVis a visual analytic tool to help experts better understand the effects of anonymization techniques on LBSN data utility. One of GSUVis's primary goals is to make it possible for people to use LBSN data, without requiring them to gain deep knowledge about data anonymization. To inform the design of GSUVis, we interviewed privacy experts, and collected their tasks and system requirements. Based on this understanding, we designed and implemented GSUVis.

Recent advances in the field discovered the influential role of two macroscopic topological structures, namely hubs and modules. We propose a visual analytics approach that allows for a systematic exploration of the role of those macroscopic topological structures on the dynamics in excitable networks. Dynamical patterns are discovered using the dynamical features of excitation ratio and co‐activation. Our approach is based on the interactive analysis of the correlation of topological and dynamical features using coordinated views. We designed suitable visual encodings for both the topological and the dynamical features. A degree map and an adjacency matrix visualization allow for the interaction with hubs and modules, respectively. A barycentric‐coordinates layout and a multi‐dimensional scaling approach allow for the analysis of excitation ratio and co‐activation, respectively. We demonstrate how the interplay of the visual encodings allows us to quickly reconstruct recent findings in the field within an interactive analysis and even discovered new patterns. We apply our approach to network models of commonly investigated topologies as well as to the structural networks representing the connectomes of different species. We evaluate our approach with domain experts in terms of its intuitiveness, expressiveness, and usefulness.",Quynh Quang Ngo;Marc-Thorsten Hütt;Lars Linsen,
EuroVis,2016,Dynamic Change Arcs to Explore Model Forecasts,10.1111/cgf.12907,"AbstractIn many planning applications, a computational model is used to make predictions about the effects of management or engineering decisions. To understand the implications of alternative scenarios, a user typically adjusts one or more of the input parameters, runs the model, and examines the outcomes using simple charts. For example, a time series showing changes in productivity or revenue might be generated. While this approach can be effective in showing the projected effects of changes to the model's input parameters, it fails to show the mechanisms that cause those changes. In order to promote understanding of model mechanics using a simple graphical device, we propose dynamic change arcs. Dynamic change arcs graphically reveal the internal model structure as cause and effect linkages. They are signed to show both positive and negative effects. We implemented this concept using a species interaction model developed for fisheries management based on a system of Lotka‐Volterra equations. The model has 10 economically important fish species and incorporates both predation and competition between species. The model predicts that changing the catch of one species can sometimes result in changes in biomass of another species through multi‐step causal chains. The dynamic change arcs make it possible to interpret the resulting complex causal chains and interaction effects. We carried out an experiment to evaluate three alternative forms of arcs for portraying causal connections in the model. The results show that all linkage representations enabled participants to reason better about complex chains of causality than not showing linkages. However, none of them were significantly better than the others.",C. St. Jean;Colin Ware;Rose F. Gamble,
EuroVis,2016,Time-Series Plots Integrated in Parallel-Coordinates Displays,10.1111/cgf.12908,"AbstractWe present a natural extension of two‐dimensional parallel‐coordinates plots for revealing relationships in time‐dependent multi‐attribute data by building on the idea that time can be considered as the third dimension. A time slice through the visualization represents a certain point in time and can be viewed as a regular parallel‐coordinates display. A vertical slice through one of the axes of the parallel‐coordinates display would show a time‐series plot. For a focus‐and‐context Integration of both views, we embed time‐series plots between two adjacent axes of the parallel‐coordinates plot. Both time‐series plots are drawn using a pseudo three‐dimensional perspective with a single vanishing point. An independent parallel‐coordinates panel that connects the two perspectively displayed time‐series plots can move forward and backward in time to reveal changes in the relationship between the time‐dependent attributes. The visualization of time‐series plots in the context of the parallel‐coordinates plot facilitates the exploration of time‐related aspects of the data without the need to switch to a separate display. We provide a consistent set of tools for selecting and contrasting subsets of the data, which are important for various application domains.",Henning Gruendl;Patrick Riehmann;Yves Pausch;Bernd Fröhlich 0001,

We have applied PhysioEx in a design study in the field of neonatal medicine, to support clinical researchers exploring physiologic data streams.

EuroVis,2016,There is More to Streamgraphs than Movies: Better Aesthetics via Ordering and Lassoing,10.1111/cgf.12910,"AbstractStreamgraphs were popularized in 2008 when The New York Times used them to visualize box office revenues for 7500 movies over 21 years. The aesthetics of a streamgraph is affected by three components: the ordering of the layers, the shape of the lowest curve of the drawing, known as the baseline, and the labels for the layers. As of today, the ordering and baseline computation algorithms proposed in the paper of Byron and Wattenberg are still considered the state of the art. However, their ordering algorithm exploits statistical properties of the movie revenue data that may not hold in other data. In addition, the baseline optimization is based on a definition of visual energy that in some cases results in considerable amount of visual distortion. We offer an ordering algorithm that works well regardless of the properties of the input data, and propose a 1‐norm based definition of visual energy and the associated solution method that overcomes the limitation of the original baseline optimization procedure. Furthermore, we propose an efficient layer labeling algorithm that scales linearly to the data size in place of the brute‐force algorithm adopted by Byron and Wattenberg. We demonstrate the advantage of our algorithms over existing techniques on a number of real world data sets.",Marco Di Bartolomeo;Yifan Hu 0001,
EuroVis,2016,Semi-automatic Vortex Flow Classification in 4D PC-MRI Data of the Aorta,10.1111/cgf.12911,"AbstractWe present an Aortic Vortex Classification (AVOCLA) that allows to classify vortices in the human aorta semi‐automatically. Current medical studies assume a strong relation between cardiovascular diseases and blood flow patterns such as vortices. Such vortices are extracted and manually classified according to specific, unstandardized properties. We employ an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group vortex‐representing path lines as basis for the subsequent classification. Classes are based on the vortex' size, orientation and shape, its temporal occurrence relative to the cardiac cycle as well as its spatial position relative to the vessel course. The classification results are presented by a 2D and 3D visualization technique. To confirm the usefulness of both approaches, we report on the results of a user study. Moreover, AVOCLA was applied to 15 datasets of healthy volunteers and patients with different cardiovascular diseases. The results of the semi‐automatic classification were qualitatively compared to a manually generated ground truth of two domain experts considering the vortex number and five specific properties.",Monique Meuschke;Benjamin Köhler 0001;Uta Preim;Bernhard Preim;Kai Lawonn,
EuroVis,2016,Critical Points of Gaussian-Distributed Scalar Fields on Simplicial Grids,10.1111/cgf.12912,"AbstractSimulations and measurements often result in scalar fields with uncertainty due to errors or output sensitivity estimates. Methods for analyzing topological features of such fields usually are not capable of handling all aspects of the data. They either are not deterministic due to using Monte Carlo approaches, approximate the data with confidence intervals, or miss out on incorporating important properties, such as correlation. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of critical points of Gaussian‐distributed scalar fields. We introduce methods to deterministically extract critical points, approximate their probability with high precision, and even capture relations between them resulting in an abstract graph representation. Unlike many other methods, we incorporate all information contained in the data including global correlation. Our work therefore is a first step towards a reliable and complete description of topological features of Gaussian‐distributed scalar fields.",Tom Liebmann;Gerik Scheuermann,
EuroVis,2016,Source Inversion by Forward Integration in Inertial Flows,10.1111/cgf.12913,"AbstractInertial particles are finite‐sized objects traveling with a certain velocity that differs from the underlying carrying flow, i.e., they are mass‐dependent and subject to inertia. Their backward integration is in practice infeasible, since a slight change in the initial velocity causes extreme changes in the recovered position. Thus, if an inertial particle is observed, it is difficult to recover where it came from. This is known as the source inversion problem, which has many practical applications in recovering the source of airborne or waterborne pollutions. Inertial trajectories live in a higher dimensional spatio‐velocity space. In this paper, we show that this space is only sparsely populated. Assuming that inertial particles are released with a given initial velocity (e.g., from rest), particles may reach a certain location only with a limited set of possible velocities. In fact, with increasing integration duration and dependent on the particle response time, inertial particles converge to a terminal velocity. We show that the set of initial positions that lead to the same location form a curve. We extract these curves by devising a derived vector field in which they appear as tangent curves. Most importantly, the derived vector field only involves forward integrated flow map gradients, which are much more stable to compute than backward trajectories. After extraction, we interactively visualize the curves in the domain and display the reached velocities using glyphs. In addition, we encode the rate of change of the terminal velocity along the curves, which gives a notion for the convergence to the terminal velocity. With this, we present the first solution to the source inversion problem that considers actual inertial trajectories. We apply the method to steady and unsteady flows in both 2D and 3D domains.",Tobias Günther;Holger Theisel,
EuroVis,2016,MCFTLE: Monte Carlo Rendering of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent Fields,10.1111/cgf.12914,"AbstractTraditionally, Lagrangian fields such as finite‐time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) are precomputed on a discrete grid and are ray casted afterwards. This, however, introduces both grid discretization errors and sampling errors during ray marching. In this work, we apply a progressive, view‐dependent Monte Carlo‐based approach for the visualization of such Lagrangian fields in time‐dependent flows. Our approach avoids grid discretization and ray marching errors completely, is consistent, and has a low memory consumption. The system provides noisy previews that converge over time to an accurate high‐quality visualization. Compared to traditional approaches, the proposed system avoids explicitly predefined fieldline seeding structures, and uses a Monte Carlo sampling strategy named Woodcock tracking to distribute samples along the view ray. An acceleration of this sampling strategy requires local upper bounds for the FTLE values, which we progressively acquire during the rendering. Our approach is tailored for high‐quality visualizations of complex FTLE fields and is guaranteed to faithfully represent detailed ridge surface structures as indicators for Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using a set of analytic test cases and real‐world numerical simulations.",Tobias Günther;Alexander Kuhn;Holger Theisel,
EuroVis,2016,Similarity Voting based Viewpoint Selection for Volumes,10.1111/cgf.12915,"AbstractPrevious viewpoint selection methods in volume visualization are generally based on some deterministic measures of viewpoint quality. However, they may not express the familiarity and aesthetic sense of users for features of interest. In this paper, we propose an image‐based viewpoint selection model to learn how visualization experts choose representative viewpoints for volumes with similar features. For a given volume, we first collect images with similar features, and these images reflect the viewpoint preferences of the experts when visualizing these features. Each collected image tallies votes to the viewpoints with the best matching based on an image similarity measure, which evaluates the spatial shape and appearance similarity between the collected image and the rendered image from the viewpoint. The optimal viewpoint is the one with the most votes from the collected images, that is, the viewpoint chosen by most visualization experts for similar features. We performed experiments on various volumes available in volume visualization, and made comparisons with traditional viewpoint selection methods. The results demonstrate that our model can select more canonical viewpoints, which are consistent with human perception.",Yubo Tao;Qirui Wang;Wei Chen 0001;Yingcai Wu;Hai Lin 0003,
EuroVis,2016,Decoupled Shading for Real-time Heterogeneous Volume Illumination,10.1111/cgf.12916,"AbstractExisting real‐time volume rendering techniques which support global illumination are limited in modeling distinct realistic appearances for classified volume data, which is a desired capability in many fields of study for illustration and education. Directly extending the emission‐absorption volume integral with heterogeneous material shading becomes unaffordable for real‐time applications because the high‐frequency view‐dependent global lighting needs to be evaluated per sample along the volume integral. In this paper, we present a decoupled shading algorithm for multi‐material volume rendering that separates global incident lighting evaluation from per‐sample material shading under multiple light sources. We show how the incident lighting calculation can be optimized through a sparse volume integration method. The quality, performance and usefulness of our new multi‐material volume rendering method is demonstrated through several examples.",Y. Zhang;Kwan-Liu Ma,
EuroVis,2016,Retailoring Box Splines to Lattices for Highly Isotropic Volume Representations,10.1111/cgf.12917,"Abstract3D box splines are defined by convolving a 1D box function with itself along different directions. In volume visualization, box splines are mainly used as reconstruction kernels that are easy to adapt to various sampling lattices, such as the Cartesian Cubic (CC), Body‐Centered Cubic (BCC), and Face‐Centered Cubic (FCC) lattices. The usual way of tailoring a box spline to a specific lattice is to span the box spline by exactly those principal directions that span the lattice itself. However, in this case, the preferred directions of the box spline and the lattice are the same, amplifying the anisotropic effects of each other. This leads to an anisotropic volume representation with strongly preferred directions. Therefore, in this paper, we retailor box splines to lattices such that the sets of vectors that span the box spline and the lattice are disjoint sets. As the preferred directions of the box spline and the lattice compensate each other, a more isotropic volume representation can be achieved. We demonstrate this by comparing different combinations of box splines and lattices concerning their anisotropic behavior in tomographic reconstruction and volume visualization.",Balázs Csébfalvi;Gergely Rácz,
EuroVis,2016,TextDNA: Visualizing Word Usage with Configurable Colorfields,10.1111/cgf.12918,"AbstractPatterns of words used in different text collections can characterize interesting properties of a corpus. However, these patterns are challenging to explore as they often involve complex relationships across many words and collections in a large space of words. In this paper, we propose a configurable colorfield design to aid this exploration. Our approach uses a dense colorfield overview to present large amounts of data in ways that make patterns perceptible. It allows flexible configuration of both data mappings and aggregations to expose different kinds of patterns, and provides interactions to help connect detailed patterns to the corpus overview. TextDNA, our prototype implementation, leverages the GPU to provide interactivity in the web browser even on large corpora. We present five case studies showing how the tool supports inquiry in corpora ranging in size from single document to millions of books.

However, the utilization of these datasets requires the decision makers to perform their exploration and analysis across a range of data scales from local to global, while maintaining a cohesive thematic context of the transition between the different granularity levels. The exploration of different information dimensions at the varied data and human scales remains to be a non‐trivial task. To this end, we present a visual analytics situational awareness environment that supports the real‐time exploration of microblog data across multiple scales of analysis. We classify microblogs based on a fine‐grained, crisis‐related categorization approach, and visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of multiple categories by coupling a spatial lens with a glyph‐based visual design. We propose a transparency‐based spatial context preserving technique that maintains a smooth transition between different spatial scales.

EuroVis,2016,Location-dependent generalization of road networks based on equivalent destinations,10.1111/cgf.12921,"AbstractSuppose a user located at a certain vertex in a road network wants to plan a route using a wayfinding map. The user's exact destination may be irrelevant for planning most of the route, because many destinations will be equivalent in the sense that they allow the user to choose almost the same paths. We propose a method to find such groups of destinations automatically and to contract the resulting clusters in a detailed map to achieve a simplified visualization. We model the problem as a clustering problem in rooted, edge‐weighted trees. Two vertices are allowed to be in the same cluster if and only if they share at least a given fraction of their path to the root. We analyze some properties of these clusterings and give a linear‐time algorithm to compute the minimum‐cardinality clustering. This algorithm may have various other applications in network visualization and graph drawing, but in this paper we apply it specifically to focus‐and‐context map generalization. When contracting shortest‐path trees in a geographic network, the computed clustering additionally provides a constant‐factor bound on the detour that results from routing using the generalized network instead of the full network. This is a desirable property for wayfinding maps.",Thomas C. van Dijk;Jan-Henrik Haunert;Johannes Oehrlein,
EuroVis,2016,Composite Flow Maps,10.1111/cgf.12922,"AbstractFlow maps are widely used to provide an overview of geospatial transportation data. Existing solutions lack the support for the interactive exploration of multiple flow components at once. Flow components are given by different materials being transported, different flow directions, or by the need for comparing alternative scenarios. In this paper, we combine flows as individual ribbons in one composite flow map. The presented approach can handle an arbitrary number of sources and sinks. To avoid visual clutter, we simplify our flow maps based on a force‐driven algorithm, accounting for restrictions with respect to application semantics. The goal is to preserve important characteristics of the geospatial context. This feature also enables us to highlight relevant spatial information on top of the flow map such as traffic conditions or accessibility. The flow map is computed on the basis of flows between zones. We describe a method for auto‐deriving zones from geospatial data according to application requirements. We demonstrate the method in real‐world applications, including transportation logistics, evacuation procedures, and water simulation.

EuroVis,2016,Exploratory Visual Analysis for Animal Movement Ecology,10.1111/cgf.12923,"AbstractMovement ecologists study animals' movement to help understand their behaviours and interactions with each other and the environment. Data from GPS loggers are increasingly important for this. These data need to be processed, segmented and summarised for further visual and statistical analysis, often using predefined parameters. Usually, this process is separate from the subsequent visual and statistical analysis, making it difficult for these results to inform the data processing and to help set appropriate scale and thresholds parameters. This paper explores the use of highly interactive visual analytics techniques to close the gap between processing raw data and exploratory visual analysis. Working closely with animal movement ecologists, we produced requirements to enable data characteristics to be determined, initial research questions to be investigated, and the suitability of data for further analysis to be assessed. We design visual encodings and interactions to meet these requirements and provide software that implements them. We demonstrate these techniques with indicative research questions for a number of bird species, provide software, and discuss wider implications for animal movement ecology.",Aidan Slingsby;E.

EuroVis,2016,AVOCADO: Visualization of Workflow-Derived Data Provenance for Reproducible Biomedical Research,10.1111/cgf.12924,"AbstractA major challenge in data‐driven biomedical research lies in the collection and representation of data provenance information to ensure that findings are reproducibile. In order to communicate and reproduce multi‐step analysis workflows executed on datasets that contain data for dozens or hundreds of samples, it is crucial to be able to visualize the provenance graph at different levels of aggregation. Most existing approaches are based on node‐link diagrams, which do not scale to the complexity of typical data provenance graphs. In our proposed approach, we reduce the complexity of the graph using hierarchical and motif‐based aggregation. Based on user action and graph attributes, a modular degree‐of‐interest (DoI) function is applied to expand parts of the graph that are relevant to the user. This interest‐driven adaptive approach to provenance visualization allows users to review and communicate complex multi‐step analyses, which can be based on hundreds of files that are processed by numerous workflows.

EuroVis,2016,From Visual Exploration to Storytelling and Back Again,10.1111/cgf.12925,"AbstractThe primary goal of visual data exploration tools is to enable the discovery of new insights. To justify and reproduce insights, the discovery process needs to be documented and communicated. A common approach to documenting and presenting findings is to capture visualizations as images or videos. Images, however, are insufficient for telling the story of a visual discovery, as they lack full provenance information and context. Videos are difficult to produce and edit, particularly due to the non‐linear nature of the exploratory process. Most importantly, however, neither approach provides the opportunity to return to any point in the exploration in order to review the state of the visualization in detail or to conduct additional analyses. In this paper we present CLUE (Capture, Label, Understand, Explain), a model that tightly integrates data exploration and presentation of discoveries. Based on provenance data captured during the exploration process, users can extract key steps, add annotations, and author “Vistories”, visual stories based on the history of the exploration. These Vistories can be shared for others to view, but also to retrace and extend the original analysis. We discuss how the CLUE approach can be integrated into visualization tools and provide a prototype implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of the model in two usage scenarios: a Gapminder‐inspired visualization to explore public health data and an example from molecular biology that illustrates how Vistories could be used in scientific journals.",Samuel Gratzl;Alexander Lex;Nils Gehlenborg;N.

Visual prominence provides a basis for describing, comparing and generating emphasis effects when combined with a set of general features of emphasis effects. Therefore, we use visual prominence and these general features to construct a new mathematical Framework for Information Visualization Emphasis, FIVE.

EuroVis,2015,MoleCollar and Tunnel Heat Map Visualizations for Conveying Spatio-Temporo-Chemical Properties Across and Along Protein Voids,10.1111/cgf.12612,"AbstractStudying the characteristics of proteins and their inner void space, including their geometry, physico‐chemical properties and dynamics are instrumental for evaluating the reactivity of the protein with other small molecules. The analysis of long simulations of molecular dynamics produces a large number of voids which have to be further explored and evaluated. In this paper we propose three new methods: two of them convey important properties along the long axis of a selected void during molecular dynamics and one provides a comprehensive picture across the void. The first two proposed methods use a specific heat map to present two types of information: an overview of all detected tunnels in the dynamics and their bottleneck width and stability over time, and an overview of a specific tunnel in the dynamics showing the bottleneck position and changes of the tunnel length over time. These methods help to select a small subset of tunnels, which are explored individually and in detail. For this stage we propose the third method, which shows in one static image the temporal evolvement of the shape of the most critical tunnel part, i.e., its bottleneck. This view is enriched with abstract depictions of different physicochemical properties of the amino acids surrounding the bottleneck. The usefulness of our newly proposed methods is demonstrated on a case study and the feedback from the domain experts is included. The biochemists confirmed that our novel methods help to convey the information about the appearance and properties of tunnels in a very intuitive and comprehensible manner.",Jan Byska;Adam Jurcík;M.

EuroVis,2015,Visual Analytics for the Exploration of Tumor Tissue Characterization,10.1111/cgf.12613,"AbstractTumors are heterogeneous tissues consisting of multiple regions with distinct characteristics. Characterization of these intra‐tumor regions can improve patient diagnosis and enable a better targeted treatment. Ideally, tissue characterization could be performed non‐invasively, using medical imaging data, to derive per voxel a number of features, indicative of tissue properties. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of this imaging‐derived feature space is prohibiting for easy exploration and analysis ‐ especially when clinical researchers require to associate observations from the feature space to other reference data, e.g., features derived from histopathological data. Currently, the exploratory approach used in clinical research consists of juxtaposing these data, visually comparing them and mentally reconstructing their relationships. This is a time consuming and tedious process, from which it is difficult to obtain the required insight. We propose a visual tool for: (1) easy exploration and visual analysis of the feature space of imaging‐derived tissue characteristics and (2) knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation and confirmation, with respect to reference data used in clinical research. We employ, as central view, a 2D embedding of the imaging‐derived features. Multiple linked interactive views provide functionality for the exploration and analysis of the local structure of the feature space, enabling linking to patient anatomy and clinical reference data. We performed an initial evaluation with ten clinical researchers. All participants agreed that, unlike current practice, the proposed visual tool enables them to identify, explore and analyze heterogeneous intra‐tumor regions and particularly, to generate and confirm hypotheses, with respect to clinical reference data.",Renata Georgia Raidou;Uulke A. van der Heide;Cuong Viet Dinh;Ghazaleh Ghobadi;Jesper Kallehauge;Marcel Breeuwer;Anna Vilanova,
EuroVis,2015,Cell lineage visualisation,10.1111/cgf.12614,"AbstractCell lineages describe the developmental history of Cell populations and are produced by combining time‐lapse imaging and image processing. Biomedical researchers study Cell lineages to understand fundamental processes such as Cell differentiation and the pharmacodynamic action of anticancer agents. Yet, the interpretation of Cell lineages is hindered by their complexity and insufficient capacity for visual analysis. We present a novel approach for interactive visualisation of Cell lineages. Based on an understanding of Cellular biology and live‐Cell imaging methodology, we identify three requirements: multimodality (Cell lineages combine spatial, temporal, and other properties), symmetry (related to lineage branching structure), and synchrony (related to temporal alignment of Cellular events). We address these by combining visual summaries of the spatiotemporal behaviour of an arbitrary number of lineages, including variation from average behaviour, with node‐link representations that emphasise the presence or absence of symmetry and synchrony. We illustrate the merit of our approach by presenting a real‐world case study where the cytotoxic action of the anticancer drug topotecan was determined.",A. Johannes Pretorius;Imtiaz A.

Our proposed ‘piling’ metaphor presents a hybrid of these techniques, leveraging each one's advantages, as well as offering the ability to scale to networks with hundreds of temporal snapshots. While the MultiPiles technique is applicable to many domains, our prototype was initially designed to help neuroscientists investigate changes in brain connectivity networks over several hundred snapshots. The piling metaphor and associated interaction and visual encodings allowed neuroscientists to explore their data, prior to a statistical analysis.

EuroVis,2015,Visual Analysis of Proximal Temporal Relationships of Social and Communicative Behaviors,10.1111/cgf.12617,"AbstractDevelopmental psychology researchers examine the temporal relationships of social and communicative behaviors, such as how a child responds to a name call, to understand early typical and atypical development and to discover early signs of autism and developmental delay. These related behaviors occur together or within close temporal proximity, forming unique patterns and relationships of interest. However, the task of finding these early signs, which are in the form of atypical behavioral patterns, becomes more challenging when behaviors of multiple children at different ages need to be compared with each other in search of generalizable patterns. The ability to visually explore the temporal relationships of behaviors, including flexible redefinition of closeness, over multiple social interaction sessions with children of different ages, can make such knowledge extraction easier. We have designed a visualization tool called TipoVis that helps psychology researchers visually explore the temporal patterns of social and communicative behaviors.

We provide a three‐level approach for exploring the finding spots in context. The overview shows the relationship of the entire suspicious document to the set of source documents. A glyph‐based view reveals the structural and textual differences and similarities of a set of finding spots and their corresponding source text fragments. For further analysis and editing of the finding spot's assessment, the actual text fragments can be embedded side‐by‐side in the diffline view.

In response, we present Perfopticon, an interactive query profiling tool that enables rapid insight into common problems such as performance bottlenecks and data skew. Perfopticon combines interactive visualizations of (1) query plans, (2) overall query execution, (3) data flow among servers, and (4) execution traces. These views coordinate multiple levels of abstraction to enable detection, isolation, and understanding of performance issues.

EuroVis,2015,Efficient Local Histogram Searching via Bitmap Indexing,10.1111/cgf.12620,"AbstractRepresenting features by local histograms is a proven technique in several volume analysis and visualization applications including feature tracking and transfer function design. The efficiency of these applications, however, is hampered by the high computational complexity of local histogram computation and matching. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to accelerate local histogram search by leveraging bitmap indexing. Our method avoids exhaustive searching of all voxels in the spatial domain by examining only the voxels whose values fall within the value range of user‐defined local features and their neighborhood. Based on the idea that the value range of local features is in general much smaller than the dynamic range of the entire dataset, we propose a local voting scheme to construct the local histograms so that only a small number of voxels need to be examined. Experimental results show that our method can reduce much computational workload compared to the conventional approaches. To demonstrate the utility of our method, an interactive interface was developed to assist users in defining target features as local histograms and identify the locations of these features in the dataset.",Tzu-Hsuan Wei;Chun-Ming Chen;Ayan Biswas,

Our method is based on a novel histogram dissimilarity measure between individual regions, derived from structural information extracted from the initial segmentation. Based on this information, our interactive system guides the user towards potential defects, provides integrated tools for their inspection, and automatically generates suggestions for their resolution. We demonstrate that our approach can reduce interaction effort and supports the user in a comprehensive investigation for high‐quality segmentations.",Alexey Karimov;Gabriel Mistelbauer;Thomas Auzinger;Stefan Bruckner,
EuroVis,2015,Compressive Volume Rendering,10.1111/cgf.12622,"AbstractCompressive rendering refers to the process of reconstructing a full image from a small subset of the rendered pixels, thereby expediting the rendering task. In this paper, we empirically investigate three image order techniques for compressive rendering that are suitable for direct volume rendering. The first technique is based on the theory of compressed sensing and leverages the sparsity of the image gradient in the Fourier domain. The latter techniques exploit smoothness properties of the rendered image; the second technique recovers the missing pixels via a total variation minimization procedure while the third technique incorporates a smoothness prior in a variational reconstruction framework employing interpolating cubic B‐splines. We compare and contrast the three techniques in terms of quality, efficiency and sensitivity to the distribution of pixels. Our results show that smoothness‐based techniques significantly outperform techniques that are based on compressed sensing and are also robust in the presence of highly incomplete information. We achieve high quality recovery with as little as 20% of the pixels distributed uniformly in screen space.",Xiaoyang Liu;Usman R. Alim,
EuroVis,2015,Learning Probabilistic Transfer Functions: A Comparative Study of Classifiers,10.1111/cgf.12623,"AbstractComplex volume rendering tasks require high‐dimensional transfer functions, which are notoriously difficult to design. One solution to this is to learn transfer functions from scribbles that the user places in the volumetric domain in an intuitive and natural manner. In this paper, we explicitly model and visualize the uncertainty in the resulting classification. To this end, we extend a previous intelligent system approach to volume rendering, and we systematically compare five supervised classification techniques – Gaussian Naive Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Random Forests – with respect to probabilistic classification, support for multiple materials, interactive performance, robustness to unreliable input, and easy parameter tuning, which we identify as key requirements for the successful use in this application. Based on theoretical considerations, as well as quantitative and visual results on volume datasets from different sources and modalities, we conclude that, while no single classifier can be expected to outperform all others under all circumstances, random forests are a useful off‐the‐shelf technique that provides fast, easy, robust and accurate results in many scenarios.",Krishna Prasad Soundararajan;Thomas Schultz 0001,
EuroVis,2015,Rule-Enhanced Transfer Function Generation for Medical Volume Visualization,10.1111/cgf.12624,"AbstractIn volume visualization, transfer functions are used to classify the volumetric data and assign optical properties to the voxels. In general, transfer functions are generated in a transfer function space, which is the feature space constructed by data values and properties derived from the data. If volumetric objects have the same or overlapping data values, it would be difficult to separate them in the transfer function space. In this paper, we present a rule‐enhanced transfer function design method that allows important structures of the volume to be more effectively separated and highlighted. We define a set of rules based on the local frequency distribution of volume attributes. A rule‐selection method based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to learn the set of rules that can distinguish the user‐specified target tissue from other tissues. In the rendering stage, voxels satisfying these rules are rendered with higher opacities in order to highlight the target tissue. The proposed method was tested on various volumetric datasets to enhance the visualization of important structures that are difficult to be visualized by traditional transfer function design methods.

In this paper, we present a novel volume denoising / smoothing method based on the L0 gradient minimization framework. This framework globally controls how many voxels with a non‐zero gradient are in the result in order to approximate important features’ structures in a sparse way. This procedure can be solved quickly by the alternating optimization strategy with half‐quadratic splitting. While the proposed L0 volume gradient minimization method can effectively remove noise in homogeneous materials, a blurring‐sharpening strategy is proposed to diminish noise or smooth local details on the boundaries. This generates salient features with smooth boundaries and visually pleasing structures.

This allows us to provide photoelastic analysis of stress tensor fields in arbitrary domains. In our model, the optical material properties, such as stress‐optic coefficient and refractive index, can either be chosen in compliance with the subject under investigation, or, in case of stress problems that do not model optical properties or that are not transparent, be chosen according to known or even new transparent materials.

EuroVis,2015,Visualization of Particle-based Data with Transparency and Ambient Occlusion,10.1111/cgf.12627,"AbstractParticle‐based simulation techniques, like the discrete element method or molecular dynamics, are widely used in many research fields. In real‐time explorative visualization it is common to render the resulting data using opaque spherical glyphs with local lighting only. Due to massive overlaps, however, inner structures of the data are often occluded rendering visual analysis impossible. Furthermore, local lighting is not sufficient as several important features like complex shapes, holes, rifts or filaments cannot be perceived well.To address both problems we present a new technique that jointly supports transparency and ambient occlusion in a consistent illumination model. Our approach is based on the emission‐absorption model of volume rendering. We provide analytic solutions to the volume rendering integral for several density distributions within a spherical glyph. Compared to constant transparency our approach preserves the three‐dimensional impression of the glyphs much better. We approximate ambient illumination with a fast hierarchical voxel cone‐tracing approach, which builds on a new real‐time voxelization of the particle data.Our implementation achieves interactive frame rates for millions of static or dynamic particles without any preprocessing.

EuroVis,2015,Exploring Traffic Dynamics in Urban Environments Using Vector-Valued Functions,10.1111/cgf.12628,"AbstractThe traffic infrastructure greatly impacts the quality of life in urban environments. To optimize this infrastructure, engineers and decision makers need to explore traffic data. In doing so, they face two important challenges: the sparseness of speed sensors that cover only a limited number of road segments, and the complexity of traffic patterns they need to analyze. In this paper we take a first step at addressing these challenges. We use New York City (NYC) taxi trips as sensors to capture traffic information. While taxis provide substantial coverage of the city, the data captured about taxi trips contain neither the location of taxis at frequent intervals nor their routes. We propose an efficient traffic model to derive speed and direction information from these data, and show that it provides reliable estimates. Using these estimates, we define a time‐varying vector‐valued function on a directed graph representing the road network, and adapt techniques used for vector fields to visualize the traffic dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our technique in several case studies that reveal interesting mobility patterns in NYC's traffic. These patterns were validated by experts from NYC's Department of Transportation and the NYC Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission, who also provided interesting insights into these results.",Jorge Poco;Harish Doraiswamy;Huy T.

Most previous works focus on visualizing trajectories obtained from global positioning system (GPS), which are detailed but less representative. In contrast, VD data report the traffic statistic at each sensing site during a time span, including speed, flow, and occupancy of each lane, which contain comprehensive traffic information for analysis. In this work, we visualize three‐year VD data of freeways in Taiwan. The visualization depicts the traffic situation at a site over time using a color‐coded chart that extends from left to right over time. The charts are vertically stacked and horizontally aligned according to VD's located mileage and data time, respectively, to provide global insight. Our system allows semantic zoom, which changes the chart appearance in a continuous manner, to enable macro‐ and micro‐ scopic visualizations. Analysts can explore events that span an area with different sizes and that persist a time span with various lengths. To ensure the feasibility of our visualization, before the system design, we conducted a study with experts who work in the national freeway bureau and the institute of transportation of Taiwan.

Based both on evidence from heterogeneous and possibly unreliable sources, and on a domain specific reasoning structure, this engine concludes with a certain probability that, e.g., the OOI is suspected of smuggling. To support decision making, we visualize the rationale, an abstraction of the complicated reasoning structure. The evidence is displayed in a color‐coded matrix that easily reveals if and where observations contradict.

Measures can then be evaluated based on predictive performance—an approach that is crucial for generalizing across datasets but has gained little attention so far.

Accordingly, the perception of color‐encoded data items depends on the surround in the rendered visualization. A method that compensates for contrast effects has been presented previously, which significantly improves the users’ accuracy in reading and comparing color encoded data. The method utilizes established perception models to compensate for contrast effects, assuming an average human observer. In this paper, we provide experiments that show a significant difference in the perception of users. We introduce methods to personalize contrast effect compensation and show that this outperforms the original method with a user study.

In particular, we show a simple and efficient fiber surface extraction algorithm based on Marching Cubes. We also show how to construct fiber surfaces interactively with geometric primitives in the range of the function. We then extend this to build user interfaces that generate parameterized families of fiber surfaces with respect to arbitrary polygons.

In order to evaluate the relative merits of the two types of plots with a common base line (i.e., reading data directly), we included three forms of stimuli, data tables, scatter plots, and parallel coordinate plots. Our results show that data tables are better suited for the value retrieval task, while parallel coordinates plots generally outperform the two other visual representations in three other tasks.

Subsequently, we use these bases to define unique 2D linear projections as viewpoints from which to visualize the data. To understand the relationships among the different projections and to discover hidden patterns, we connect these projections through dynamic projections that create smooth animated transitions between pairs of projections. We introduce the view transition graph, which provides flexible navigation among these projections to facilitate an intuitive exploration.

EuroVis,2015,Uncovering Representative Groups in Multidimensional Projections,10.1111/cgf.12640,"AbstractMultidimensional projection‐based visualization methods typically rely on clustering and attribute selection mechanisms to enable visual analysis of multidimensional data. Clustering is often employed to group similar instances according to their distance in the visual space. However, considering only distances in the visual space may be misleading due to projection errors as well as the lack of guarantees to ensure that distinct clusters contain instances with different content. Identifying clusters made up of a few elements is also an issue for most clustering methods. In this work we propose a novel multidimensional projection‐based visualization technique that relies on representative instances to define clusters in the visual space. Representative instances are selected by a deterministic sampling scheme derived from matrix decomposition, which is sensitive to the variability of data while still been able to handle classes with a small number of instances. Moreover, the sampling mechanism can easily be adapted to select relevant attributes from each cluster. Therefore, our methodology unifies sampling, clustering, and feature selection in a simple framework.

EuroVis,2015,Visualnostics: Visual Guidance Pictograms for Analyzing Projections of High-dimensional Data,10.1111/cgf.12641,"AbstractThe visual analysis of multivariate projections is a challenging task, because complex visual structures occur. This causes fatigue or misinterpretations, which distorts the analysis. In fact, the same projection can lead to different analysis results. We provide visual guidance pictograms to improve objectivity of the visual search. A visual guidance pictogram is an iconic visual density map encoding the visual structure of certain data properties. By using them to guide the analysis, structures in the projection can be better understood and mentally linked to properties in the data. We introduce a systematic scheme for designing such pictograms and provide a set of pictograms for standard visual tasks, such as correlation and distribution analysis, for standard projections like scatterplots, RadVis, and Star Coordinates. We conduct a study that compares the visual analysis of real data with and without the support of guidance pictograms. Our tests show that the training effort for a visual search can be decreased and the analysis bias can be reduced by supporting the user's visual search with guidance pictograms.",Dirk J.

Associative browsing represents a common and intuitive set of exploratory strategies in which users step iteratively from familiar to novel bits of information. In this paper, we examine associative browsing as a strategy for bottom‐up exploration of large, heterogeneous networks. We present Refinery, an interactive visualization system informed by guidelines for associative browsing drawn from literature on exploratory information‐seeking. These guidelines motivate Refinery's query model, which allows users to simply and expressively construct queries using heterogeneous sets of nodes. This system computes degree‐of‐interest scores for associated content using a fast, random‐walk algorithm. Refinery visualizes query nodes within a subgraph of results, providing explanatory context, facilitating serendipitous discovery, and stimulating continued exploration. A study of 12 academic researchers using Refinery to browse publication data demonstrates how the system enables discovery of valuable new content, even within existing areas of expertise.",Sanjay Kairam;Nathalie Henry Riche;Steven Mark Drucker;Roland Fernandez;Jeffrey Heer,

However, certain networks benefit from the grouping of links instead of nodes. Link communities, for example, are a form of link groups that describe high‐quality overlapping node communities. There is a conceptual gap between node groups and link groups that poses an interesting visualization challenge. We introduce the Dual Adjacency Matrix to bridge this gap. This matrix combines node and link group techniques via a generalization that also enables it to be coordinated with a node‐link‐contour diagram. These methods have been implemented in a prototype that we evaluated with an information scientist and neuroscientist via interviews and prototype walk‐throughs.

We present Detangler, a system that supports visual analysis of group cohesion in multiplex networks through dual linked views. These views feature new data abstractions derived from the original multiplex network: the substrate network and the catalyst network. We contribute two novel techniques that allow the user to analyze the complex structure of the multiplex network without the extreme visual clutter that would result from simply showing it directly. The harmonized layout visual encoding technique provides spatial stability between the substrate and catalyst views. The pivot brushing interaction technique supports linked highlighting between the views based on computations in the underlying multiplex network to leapfrog between subsets of catalysts and substrates.

EuroVis,2015,Visualization of Object-Centered Vulnerability to Possible Flood Hazards,10.1111/cgf.12645,"AbstractAs flood events tend to happen more frequently, there is a growing demand for understanding the vulnerability of infrastructure to flood‐related hazards. Such demand exists both for flood management personnel and the general public. Modern software tools are capable of generating uncertainty‐aware flood predictions. However, the information addressing individual objects is incomplete, scattered, and hard to extract. In this paper, we address vulnerability to flood‐related hazards focusing on a specific building. Our approach is based on the automatic extraction of relevant information from a large collection of pre‐simulated flooding events, called a scenario pool. From this pool, we generate uncertainty‐aware visualizations conveying the vulnerability of the building of interest to different kinds of flooding events. On the one hand, we display the adverse effects of the disaster on a detailed level, ranging from damage inflicted on the building facades or cellars to the accessibility of the important infrastructure in the vicinity. On the other hand, we provide visual indications of the events to which the building of interest is vulnerable in particular. Our visual encodings are displayed in the context of urban 3D renderings to establish an intuitive relation between geospatial and abstract information. We combine all the visualizations in a lightweight interface that enables the user to study the impacts and vulnerabilities of interest and explore the scenarios of choice.

EuroVis,2015,Quantitative Measures for Cartogram Generation Techniques,10.1111/cgf.12647,"AbstractCartograms are used to visualize geographically distributed data by scaling the regions of a map (e.g., US states) such that their areas are proportional to some data associated with them (e.g., population). Thus the cartogram computation problem can be considered as a map deformation problem where the input is a planar polygonal map M and an assignment of some positive weight for each region. The goal is to create a deformed map M′, where the area of each region realizes the weight assigned to it (no cartographic error) while the overall map remains readable and recognizable (e.g., the topology, relative positions and shapes of the regions remain as close to those before the deformation as possible). Although several such measures of cartogram quality are well‐known, different cartogram generation methods optimize different features and there is no standard set of quantitative metrics. In this paper we define such a set of seven quantitative measures, designed to evaluate how faithfully a cartogram represents the desired weights and to estimate the readability of the final representation.

We focus on mosaic cartograms: cartograms that use multiples of simple tiles – usually squares or hexagons – to represent regions. Mosaic cartograms communicate well data that consist of, or can be cast into, small integer units (for example, electorial college votes). In addition, they allow users to accurately compare regions and can often maintain a (schematized) version of the input regions’ shapes. We propose the first fully automated method to construct mosaic cartograms. To do so, we first introduce mosaic drawings of triangulated planar graphs. We then show how to modify mosaic drawings into mosaic cartograms with low cartographic error while maintaining correct adjacencies between regions.

EuroVis,2015,"Visualizing Time-Specific Hurricane Predictions, with Uncertainty, from Storm Path Ensembles",10.1111/cgf.12649,"AbstractThe U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) issues advisories every six hours during the life of a hurricane. These advisories describe the current state of the storm, and its predicted path, size, and wind speed over the next five days. However, from these data alone, the question “What is the likelihood that the storm will hit Houston with hurricane strength winds between 12:00 and 14:00 on Saturday?” cannot be directly answered. To address this issue, the NHC has recently begun making an ensemble of potential storm paths available as part of each storm advisory. Since each path is parameterized by time, predicted values such as wind speed associated with the path can be inferred for a specific time period by analyzing the statistics of the ensemble. This paper proposes an approach for generating smooth scalar fields from such a predicted storm path ensemble, allowing the user to examine the predicted state of the storm at any chosen time. As a demonstration task, we show how our approach can be used to support a visualization tool, allowing the user to display predicted storm position – including its uncertainty – at any time in the forecast. In our approach, we estimate the likelihood of hurricane risk for a fixed time at any geospatial location by interpolating simplicial depth values in the path ensemble. Adaptivelysized radial basis functions are used to carry out the interpolation. Finally, geometric fitting is used to produce a simple graphical visualization of this likelihood. We also employ a non‐linear filter, in time, to assure frame‐to‐frame coherency in the visualization as the prediction time is advanced. We explain the underlying algorithm and definitions, and give a number of examples of how our algorithm performs for several different storm predictions, and for two different sources of predicted path ensembles.",Le Liu 0007;Mahsa Mirzargar;Robert M.

For this reason, weather forecast plays a major role in society. Currently weather forecasts are based on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that generate a representation of the atmospheric flow. Interactive visualization of geo‐spatial data has been widely used in order to facilitate the analysis of NWP models. This paper presents a visualization system for the analysis of spatio‐temporal patterns in short‐term weather forecasts. For this purpose, we provide an interactive visualization interface that guides users from simple visual overviews to more advanced visualization techniques. Our solution presents multiple views that include a timeline with geo‐referenced maps, an integrated webmap view, a forecast operation tool, a curve‐pattern selector, spatial filters, and a linked meteogram. Two key contributions of this work are the timeline with geo‐referenced maps and the curve‐pattern selector. The latter provides novel functionality that allows users to specify and search for meaningful patterns in the data.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that fills this gap through visual characterization and exploration of local structure‐performance correlations. We also propose a formula that correlates the structural features with the performance bottlenecks. Since research into BHJ materials is highly multidisciplinary, our framework enables a visual feedback strategy that allows scientists to build intuition about the best choices of fabrication parameters.

EuroVis,2015,Visual Analytics for Correlation-Based Comparison of Time Series Ensembles,10.1111/cgf.12653,"AbstractAn established approach to studying interrelations between two non‐stationary time series is to compute the ‘windowed’ cross‐correlation (WCC). The time series are divided into intervals and the cross‐correlation between corresponding intervals is calculated. The outcome is a matrix that describes the correlation between two time series for different intervals and varying time lags. This important technique can only be used to compare two single time series. However, many applications require the comparison of ensembles of time series. Therefore, we propose a visual analytics approach that extends the WCC to support a correlation‐based comparison of two ensembles of time series. We compute the pairwise WCC between all time series from the two ensembles, which results in hundreds of thousands of WCC matrices. Statistical measures are used to derive a concise description of the time‐varying correlations between the ensembles as well as the uncertainty of the correlation values. We further introduce a visually scalable overview visualization of the computed correlation and uncertainty information. These components are combined with multiple linked views into a visual analytics system to support configuration of the WCC as well as detailed analysis of correlation patterns between two ensembles.

Since the amount of DR algorithms from which users may choose is steadily increasing, assessing their quality becomes more and more important. We present a novel technique to quantify and compare the quality of DR algorithms that is based on persistent homology. An inherent beneficial property of persistent homology is its robustness against noise which makes it well suited for real world data. Our pipeline informs about the best DR technique for a given data set and chosen metric (e.g. preservation of local distances) and provides knowledge about the local quality of an embedding, thereby helping users understand the shortcomings of the selected DR method.

GraphUnit simplifies the evaluation process by allowing visualization designers to easily configure user studies for their web‐based graph visualizations, deploy them online, use Mechanical Turk to attract participants, collect user responses and store them in a database, and analyze incoming results automatically using appropriate statistical tools and graphs.

This paper presents an approach to a comparative visualization of the inertial particles’ separation behavior. For this, we define the Finite‐Time Mass Separation (FTMS), a scalar field that measures at each point in the domain how quickly inertial particles separate that were released from the same location but with slightly different mass. Extracting and visualizing the mass that induces the largest separation provides a simplified view on the critical masses. By using complementary coordinated views, we additionally visualize corresponding inertial particle trajectories in space‐time by integral curves and surfaces. For a quantitative analysis, we plot Euclidean and arc length‐based distances to a reference particle over time, which allows to observe the temporal evolution of separation events.

In order to visualize superimposed flux effects, we introduce a new graphical metaphor, the stream feather, which adds extensions to stream tubes pointing in the directions of deviating fluxes. The resulting unified visualization of macroscopic advection and microscopic diffusion allows for deeper insight into complex flow scenarios that cannot be achieved with current volume and surface rendering techniques alone.Our approach for flux decomposition and visualization of advective‐diffusive flows can be applied to any kind of (simulation) data if velocity and concentration data are available.

Usually, stream surface seeding is carried out manually in time‐consuming trial and error procedures. Only recently automatic selection methods were proposed. Local methods support the selection of a set of stream surfaces, but, contrary to global selection methods, they evaluate only the quality of the seeding lines but not the quality of the whole stream surfaces. Global methods, on the other hand, only support the selection of a single optimal stream surface until now. However, for certain flow fields a single stream surface is not sufficient to represent all flow features.In our work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a global selection technique for a set of stream surfaces. All selected surfaces optimize global stream surface quality measures and are guaranteed to be mutually distant, such that they can convey different flow features. Our approach is an efficient extension of the most recent global selection method for single stream surfaces.

While silhouette enhancements and local transparency mappings proved useful for semi‐transparent depictions, they still introduce visual clutter when surfaces grow more complex. An effective visualization of the flow requires a balance between the presentation of interesting surface parts and the avoidance of occlusions that hinder the view. In this paper, we extend the concept of opacity optimization to surfaces to obtain a global approach to the occlusion problem. Starting with a partition of the surfaces into patches, we compute per‐patch opacity as minimizer of a bounded‐variable least‐squares problem. For the final rendering, opacity is interpolated on the surfaces.

EuroVis,2014,Extracting Features from Time-Dependent Vector Fields Using Internal Reference Frames,10.1111/cgf.12358,"AbstractExtracting features from complex, time‐dependent flow fields remains a significant challenge despite substantial research efforts, especially because most flow features of interest are defined with respect to a given reference frame. Pathline‐based techniques, such as the FTLE field, are complex to implement and resource intensive, whereas scalar transforms, such as λ2, often produce artifacts and require somewhat arbitrary thresholds. Both approaches aim to analyze the flow in a more suitable frame, yet neither technique explicitly constructs one.This paper introduces a new data‐driven technique to compute internal reference frames for large‐scale complex flows. More general than uniformly moving frames, these frames can transform unsteady fields, which otherwise require substantial processing of resources, into a sequence of individual snapshots that can be analyzed using the large body of steady‐flow analysis techniques. Our approach is simple, theoretically well‐founded, and uses an embarrassingly parallel algorithm for structured as well as unstructured data. Using several case studies from fluid flow and turbulent combustion, we demonstrate that internal frames are distinguished, result in temporally coherent structures, and can extract well‐known as well as notoriously elusive features one snapshot at a time.",Harsh Bhatia;Valerio Pascucci;Robert M.

The characterization is based on the analysis of the support of the probability density functions (PDF) of the input data. Given two scalar fields representing reliable estimations of the bounds of this support, our strategy identifies mandatory critical points: spatial regions and function ranges where critical points have to occur in any realization of the input. The algorithm provides a global pairing scheme for mandatory critical points which is used to construct mandatory join and split trees. These trees enable a visual exploration of the common topological structure of all possible realizations of the uncertain data. To allow multi‐scale visualization, we introduce a simplification scheme for mandatory critical point pairs revealing the most dominant features. Our technique is purely combinatorial and handles parametric distribution models and ensemble data. It does not depend on any computational parameter and does not suffer from numerical inaccuracy or global inconsistency. The algorithm exploits ideas of the established join/split tree computation. It is therefore simple to implement, and its complexity is output‐sensitive.

Dissipation elements segment a domain according to the source and destination of streamlines in the gradient flow field of a scalar function f :  → ℝ. They have traditionally been computed by numerically integrating streamlines from the center of each voxel in the positive and negative gradient directions, and grouping those voxels whose streamlines terminate at the same extremal pair. We show that the same structures map well to combinatorial topology concepts developed recently in the visualization community. Namely, dissipation elements correspond to sets of cells of the Morse‐Smale complex. The topology‐based formulation enables a more exploratory analysis of the nature of dissipation elements, in particular, in understanding their stability with respect to small scale variations.

In this paper, we present a fast CPU method for direct volume rendering of particle data with RBF kernels. We propose a novel two‐pass algorithm: first sampling the RBF field using coherent bounding hierarchy traversal, then subsequently integrating samples along ray segments. Our approach performs interactively for a range of data sets from molecular dynamics and astrophysics up to 82 million particles. It does not rely on level of detail or subsampling, and offers better reconstruction quality than structured volume rendering of the same data, exhibiting comparable performance and requiring no additional preprocessing or memory footprint other than the BVH. Lastly, our technique enables multi‐field, multi‐material classification of particle data, providing better insight and analysis.",Aaron Knoll;Ingo Wald;Paul A.

EuroVis,2014,"Towards an Unbiased Comparison of CC, BCC, and FCC Lattices in Terms of Prealiasing",10.1111/cgf.12364,"AbstractIn the literature on optimal regular volume sampling, the Body‐Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice has been proven to be optimal for sampling spherically band‐limited signals above the Nyquist limit. On the other hand, if the sampling frequency is below the Nyquist limit, the Face‐Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice was demonstrated to be optimal in reducing the prealiasing effect. In this paper, we confirm that the FCC lattice is indeed optimal in this sense in a certain interval of the sampling frequency. By theoretically estimating the prealiasing error in a realistic range of the sampling frequency, we show that in other frequency intervals, the BCC lattice and even the traditional Cartesian Cubic (CC) lattice are expected to minimize the prealiasing. The BCC lattice is superior over the FCC lattice if the sampling frequency is not significantly below the Nyquist limit. Interestingly, if the original signal is drastically undersampled, the CC lattice is expected to provide the lowest prealiasing error. Additionally, we give a comprehensible clarification that the sampling efficiency of the FCC lattice is lower than that of the BCC lattice. Although this is a well‐known fact, the exact percentage has been erroneously reported in the literature. Furthermore, for the sake of an unbiased comparison, we propose to rotate the Marschner‐Lobb test signal such that an undue advantage is not given to either lattice.",Viktor Vad;Balázs Csébfalvi;Peter Rautek;M.

EuroVis,2014,"InSpectr: Multi-Modal Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis of Spectral Data",10.1111/cgf.12365,"AbstractThis paper addresses the increasing demand in industry for methods to analyze and visualize multimodal data involving a spectral modality. Two data modalities are used: high‐resolution X‐ray computed tomography (XCT) for structural characterization and low‐resolution X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) spectral data for elemental decomposition. We present InSpectr, an integrated tool for the interactive exploration and visual analysis of multimodal, multiscalar data. The tool has been designed around a set of tasks identified by domain experts in the fields of XCT and XRF. It supports registered single scalar and spectral datasets optionally coupled with element maps and reference spectra. InSpectr is instantiating various linked views for the integration of spatial and non‐spatial information to provide insight into an industrial component's structural and material composition: views with volume renderings of composite and individual 3D element maps visualize global material composition; transfer functions defined directly on the spectral data and overlaid pie‐chart glyphs show elemental composition in 2D slice‐views; a representative aggregated spectrum and spectra density histograms are introduced to provide a global overview in the spectral view. Spectral magic lenses, spectrum probing and elemental composition probing of points using a pie‐chart view and a periodic table view aid the local material composition analysis. Two datasets are investigated to outline the usefulness of the presented techniques: a 3D virtually created phantom with a brass metal alloy and a real‐world 2D water phantom with insertions of gold, barium, and gadolinium.

EuroVis,2014,Distortion-Guided Structure-Driven Interactive Exploration of High-Dimensional Data,10.1111/cgf.12366,"AbstractDimension reduction techniques are essential for feature selection and feature extraction of complex high‐dimensional data. These techniques, which construct low‐dimensional representations of data, are typically geometrically motivated, computationally efficient and approximately preserve certain structural properties of the data. However, they are often used as black box solutions in data exploration and their results can be difficult to interpret. To assess the quality of these results, quality measures, such as co‐ranking [LV09], have been proposed to quantify structural distortions that occur between high‐dimensional and low‐dimensional data representations. Such measures could be evaluated and visualized point‐wise to further highlight erroneous regions [MLGH13]. In this work, we provide an interactive visualization framework for exploring high‐dimensional data via its two‐dimensional embeddings obtained from dimension reduction, using a rich set of user interactions. We ask the following question: what new insights do we obtain regarding the structure of the data, with interactive manipulations of its embeddings in the visual space? We augment the two‐dimensional embeddings with structural abstractions obtained from hierarchical clusterings, to help users navigate and manipulate subsets of the data. We use point‐wise distortion measures to highlight interesting regions in the domain, and further to guide our selection of the appropriate level of clusterings that are aligned with the regions of interest. Under the static setting, point‐wise distortions indicate the level of structural uncertainty within the embeddings. Under the dynamic setting, on‐the‐fly updates of point‐wise distortions due to data movement and data deletion reflect structural relations among different parts of the data, which may lead to new and valuable insights.",Shusen Liu 0001;Bei Wang 0001;Peer-Timo Bremer;Valerio Pascucci,

Visual analysis of these data potentially leads to a better diagnosis and risk assessment of various cardiovascular diseases. Recent advances have improved the speed and quality of the imaging data considerably. Nevertheless, the data remains compromised by noise and a lack of spatiotemporal resolution. Besides imaging data, also numerical simulations are employed. These are based on mathematical models of specific features of physical reality. However, these models require realistic parameters and boundary conditions based on measurements. We propose to use data assimilation to bring measured data and physically‐based simulation together, and to harness the mutual benefits. The accuracy and noise robustness of the coupled approach is validated using an analytic flow field.

EuroVis,2014,Comparative Blood Flow Visualization for Cerebral Aneurysm Treatment Assessment,10.1111/cgf.12369,"AbstractA pathological vessel dilation in the brain, termed cerebral aneurysm, bears a high risk of rupture, and is associated with a high mortality. In recent years, incidental findings of unruptured aneurysms have become more frequent, mainly due to advances in medical imaging. The pathological condition is often treated with a stent that diverts the blood flow from the aneurysm sac back to the original vessel. Prior to treatment, neuroradiologists need to decide on the optimal stent configuration and judge the long‐term rupture risk, for which blood flow information is essential. Modern patient‐specific simulations can model the hemodynamics for various stent configurations, providing important indicators to support the decision‐making process. However, the necessary visual analysis of these data becomes tedious and time‐consuming, because of the abundance of information. We introduce a comprehensive comparative visualization that integrates morphology with blood flow indicators to facilitate treatment assessment. To deal with the visual complexity, we propose a details‐on‐demand approach, combining established medical visualization techniques with innovative glyphs inspired by information visualization concepts.

Previous visualizations of biochemical processes were exploiting the results of agent‐based modeling. Such modeling aims at reproducing accurately the stochastic nature of molecular interactions. However, it is impossible to expect events of interest happening at a certain time and location, which is impractical for storytelling. To obtain the means of controlling molecular interactions, we propose to govern passive agents with an omniscient intelligence, instead of giving to the agents the freedom of initiating reaction autonomously. This makes it possible to generate illustrative animated stories that communicate the functioning of the molecular machinery. The rendering performance delivers for interactive framerates of massive amounts of data, based on the dynamic tessellation capabilities of modern graphics cards.

In this paper, we propose GuideME: a novel slice‐guided semiautomatic multivariate volume exploration approach. Specifically, the approach comprises four stages: attribute inspection, guided uncertainty‐aware lasso creation, automated feature extraction and optional spatial fine tuning and visualization. Throughout the exploration process, the user does not need to interact with the parameter views at all and examples of complex real‐world data demonstrate the usefulness, efficiency and ease‐of‐use of our method.",Liang Zhou;Charles D.

EuroVis,2014,Visualization of Medicine Prescription Behavior,10.1111/cgf.12372,"AbstractMedicine prescriptions play an important role in medical treatments. More insight in medicine prescription behavior can lead to more efficient and effective treatments, as well as reflection on prescription behavior for specific physicians, types of medicines, or classes of patients. Most current medical visualization systems show health data only from the perspective of patients, whereas to understand prescription behavior multiple perspectives are relevant. We present a new approach to visualize prescription data from four different perspectives: physician, patient, medicine, and prescription. Information about physicians, patients, and medicines is shown in three tables; relations between selected items in these tables are shown using custom glyphs and histograms. These tables can also be used to define selections of prescriptions which can be compared to each other by showing a variety of metrics. This enables physicians and possibly other stakeholders to perform a wide variety of queries and inspections, while the use of familiar metaphors, such as tables and histograms, enables them to use the system in short time. This was confirmed by an evaluation session with six neurologists from an institute of epileptology. Our system is tailored to medicine prescription data, but we argue that the underlying pattern in the data is ubiquitous, and that hence our approach can be useful for many other cases where A provides B to C.",Paul van der Corput;Johan Arends;Jarke J. van Wijk,

The approach combines a summary view that provides information about an entire corpus of molecules with a detail view that visualizes classifier results directly on protein surfaces. Rather than displaying miniature 3D views of each molecule, the summary provides 2D glyphs of each protein surface arranged in a reorderable, small‐multiples grid. Each summary is specifically designed to support visual aggregation to allow the viewer to both get a sense of aggregate properties as well as the details that form them. The detail view provides a 3D visualization of each protein surface coupled with interaction techniques designed to support key tasks, including spatial aggregation and automated camera touring.

This relation is used for pair‐wise comparison of local surface attributes (e.g. electrostatic potential). We combine the difference value as well as the comparability as derived from the local matching quality in a 3D molecular visualization by mapping them to color.

To address this problem, we present and evaluate a new visual analytics system, which offers interactive exploration and tagging of social networks extracted from newspapers. For the visual exploration of the network, we extract “interesting” neighbourhoods of nodes, using a new degree of interest (DOI) measure based on edges instead of nodes. It improves the seminal definition of DOI, which we find to produce the same “globally interesting” neighbourhoods in our use case, regardless of the query. Our approach allows answering different user queries appropriately, avoiding uniform search results.We propose a user‐driven pattern‐based classifier for discovery and tagging of non‐taxonomic semantic relations. Our approach does not require any a‐priori user knowledge, such as expertise in syntax or pattern creation. An evaluation shows that our classifier is capable of identifying known lexico‐syntactic patterns as well as various domain‐specific patters. Our classifier yields good results already with a small amount of training, and continuously improves through user feedback.We conduct a user study to evaluate whether our visual interactive system has an impact on how users tag relationships, as compared to traditional text‐based interfaces.

EuroVis,2014,Methods for Compensating Contrast Effects in Information Visualization,10.1111/cgf.12379,"AbstractColor, as one of the most effective visual variables, is used in many techniques to encode and group data points according to different features. Relations between features and groups appear as visual patterns in the visualization. However, optical illusions may bias the perception at the first level of the analysis process. For instance, in pixel‐based visualizations contrast effects make pixels appear brighter if surrounded by a darker area, which distorts the encoded metric quantity of the data points. Even if we are aware of these perceptual issues, our visual cognition system is not able to compensate these effects accurately. To overcome this limitation, we present a color optimization algorithm based on perceptual metrics and color perception models to reduce physiological contrast or color effects. We evaluate our technique with a user study and find that the technique doubles the accuracy of users comparing and estimating color encoded data values. Since the presented technique can be used in any application without adaption to the visualization itself, we are able to demonstrate its effectiveness on data visualizations in different domains.",Sebastian Mittelstädt;Andreas Stoffel;Daniel A.

We adopt the term ‘multiplexing’ from tele‐ and data communication to encompass all such overlapping mechanisms. We establish 10 categories of visual multiplexing mechanisms.

Second, we highlight edges that are being traced at any given moment or have been the focus of recent attention. Third, we track recently viewed nodes and increase the saliency of their neighborhoods. All visual responses are unobtrusive and easily ignored to avoid unintentional distraction and to account for the imprecise and low‐resolution nature of eye‐tracking. We also introduce a novel gaze‐correction approach that relies on knowledge about the network layout to reduce eye‐tracking error.

Recent developments in the field of indoor positioning systems make the acquisition and availability of visitor behavior data more attainable. However, the analysis of such data remains a challenge due to its noisiness, complexity and sheer size. The current paper applies information visualization techniques to analyze this data and make it more accessible to museum curators and personnel. We first provide a detailed description of the application domain including an analysis of the curators' information needs and a description of how a dataset on visitors' spatiotemporal behavior could be acquired. In order to address the curators' needs, we designed a visualization to encode and convey the information based on a newly adjusted visual glyph that we call Tangram Diagrams. We thereby focus on the adaptability of the technique to a particular domain, rather than on the novelty aspects of the technique itself. We have evaluated our design decisions empirically, and conducted an expert study to describe the insights gained and the value of the information obtained from the visualization. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we apply information visualization to the museum domain and discuss how it extends to general indoor spatiotemporal behavior analysis.

EuroVis,2014,Metro Transit-Centric Visualization for City Tour Planning,10.1111/cgf.12383,"AbstractIn general, city trip planning consists of two main steps: knowing Points‐Of‐Interest (POIs), and then planning a tour route from the current point to next preferred POIs. We mainly consider the metro for traveling around touristic cities as the main means of transportation. In this context, existing tools lack a capability to effectively visualize POIs on the metro map for trip planning. To bridge this gap, we propose an interactive framework that holistically combines presentations of POIs and a metro network. Our idea is to identify popular POIs based on visual worth computation, and to introduce POI discovery for effectively identifying POIs within reach of a metro network for users. We use octilinear layouts to highlight the metro network, and show representative POI images in the layout space visualized within a user‐specified viewing window.

In this paper, we present an integrated solution that is based on multidimensional, time‐dependent ensemble simulations of incident scenarios and protective measures. We provide scalable interfaces which facilitate and accelerate setting up multiple time‐varying parameters for generating a pool of pre‐cooked scenarios. In case of an emergency, disaster managers can quickly extract relevant information from the pool to deal with the situation at hand. An interactive 3D‐view conveys details about how a response plan has to be executed. Linked information visualization and ranking views allow for a quick assessment of many plans.

Varieties of mixed research data sets exist and scientists aim to derive or validate hypotheses to find undiscovered knowledge. Many analysis techniques identify relations of an entire dataset only. This may level the characteristic behavior of different subgroups in the data. Like automatic subspace clustering, we aim at identifying interesting subgroups and attribute sets. We present a visual‐interactive system that supports scientists to explore interesting relations between aggregated bins of multivariate attributes in mixed data sets. The abstraction of data to bins enables the application of statistical dependency tests as the measure of interestingness. An overview matrix view shows all attributes, ranked with respect to the interestingness of bins. Complementary, a node‐link view reveals multivariate bin relations by positioning dependent bins close to each other. The system supports information drill‐down based on both expert knowledge and algorithmic support. Finally, visual‐interactive subset clustering assigns multivariate bin relations to groups. A list‐based cluster result representation enables the scientist to communicate multivariate findings at a glance. We demonstrate the applicability of the system with two case studies from the earth observation domain and the prostate cancer research domain.

We present the Glyph SPLOM as a general alternative to the traditional correlation based heatmap and the scatterplot matrix in two examples: demography data from the World Health Organization (WHO), and gene expression data from developmental biology. By using both, dependency class and strength, the Glyph SPLOM illustrates high dimensional data in more detail than a heatmap but with more summarization than a SPLOM.

In this work, we present an integrated framework with visual representations that allows the user to incrementally build and verify models in three model spaces that support local pattern discovery and summarization: model complementarity, model diversity, and model representivity. Visual representations are designed and implemented for each of the model spaces. Our visualizations enable the discovery of complementary variables, i.e., those that perform well in modeling different subsets of data points. They also support the isolation of local models based on a diversity measure.

EuroVis,2014,Authoring Narrative Visualizations with Ellipsis,10.1111/cgf.12392,"AbstractData visualization is now a popular medium for journalistic storytelling. However, current visualization tools either lack support for storytelling or require significant technical expertise. Informed by interviews with journalists, we introduce a model of storytelling abstractions that includes state‐based scene structure, dynamic annotations and decoupled coordination of multiple visualization components. We instantiate our model in Ellipsis: a system that combines a domain‐specific language (DSL) for storytelling with a graphical interface for story authoring. User interactions are automatically translated into statements in the Ellipsis DSL. By enabling storytelling without programming, the Ellipsis interface lowers the threshold for authoring narrative visualizations. We evaluate Ellipsis through example applications and user studies with award‐winning journalists. Study participants find Ellipsis to be a valuable prototyping tool that can empower journalists in the creation of interactive narratives.",Arvind Satyanarayan;Jeffrey Heer,
EuroVis,2014,Evaluating the Impact of User Characteristics and Different Layouts on an Interactive Visualization for Decision Making,10.1111/cgf.12393,"AbstractThere is increasing evidence that user characteristics can have a significant impact on visualization effectiveness, suggesting that visualizations could be designed to better fit each user's specific needs. Most studies to date, however, have looked at static visualizations. Studies considering interactive visualizations have only looked at a limited number of user characteristics, and consider either low‐level tasks (e.g., value retrieval), or high‐level tasks (in particular: discovery), but not both. This paper contributes to this line of work by looking at the impact of a large set of user characteristics on user performance with interactive visualizations, for both low and high‐level tasks. We focus on interactive visualizations that support decision making, exemplified by a visualization known as Value Charts. We include in the study two versions of ValueCharts that differ in terms of layout, to ascertain whether layout mediates the impact of individual differences and could be considered as a form of personalization. Our key findings are that (i) performance with low and high‐level tasks is affected by different user characteristics, and (ii) users with low visual working memory perform better with a horizontal layout. We discuss how these findings can inform the provision of personalized support to visualization processing.",Cristina Conati;Giuseppe Carenini;Enamul Hoque;Ben Steichen;Dereck Toker,
EuroVis,2014,Semi-Automatic Editing of Graphs with Customized Layouts,10.1111/cgf.12394,"AbstractUsually visualization is applied to gain insight into data. Yet consuming the data in form of visual representation is not always enough. Instead, users need to edit the data, preferably through the same means used to visualize them. In this work, we present a semi‐automatic approach to visual editing of graphs. The key idea is to use an interactive EditLens that defines where an edit operation affects an already customized and established graph layout. Locally optimal node positions within the lens and edge routes to connected nodes are calculated according to different criteria. This spares the user much manual work, but still provides sufficient freedom to accommodate application‐dependent layout constraints. Our approach utilizes the advantages of multi‐touch gestures, and is also compatible with classic mouse and keyboard interaction. Preliminary user tests have been conducted with researchers from bio‐informatics who need to manually maintain a slowly, but constantly growing molecular network. As the user feedback indicates, our solution significantly improves the editing procedure applied so far.",Stefan Gladisch;Heidrun Schumann;M. Ernst;Georg Füllen;Christian Tominski,

We explore the development of layouts that exploit the directed acyclic nature of Android application permission data to develop a new explicit layout technique that incorporates aspects of set membership, node‐link diagrams and matrix layouts. By grouping applications based on sets of requested permissions, a structure can be formed with partially ordered relations. The Papilio layout shows sets of applications centrally, the relations among applications on one side and application permissions, as the reason behind the existence of the partial order, on the other side. Using Papilio to explore a set of Android applications as a case study has led to new security findings regarding permission usage by Android applications.",M. Hosseinkhani Loorak;Philip W. L.

Our approach supports exploratory tasks for the comparison of univariate, geo‐referenced sensor data, in particular for anomaly detection. We split the recordings into fixed‐length patterns and show them in order to compare them over time and space using two linked views. Apart from geo‐based comparison across sensors we also support different temporal patterns to discover seasonal effects, anomalies and periodicities.The methods we use are best practices in the information visualization domain. They cover the daily, the weekly and seasonal and patterns of the data. Daily patterns can be analyzed in a clustering‐based view, weekly patterns in a calendar‐based view and seasonal patters in a projection‐based view. The connectivity of the sensors can be analyzed through a dedicated topological network view. We assist the domain expert with interaction techniques to make the results understandable. As a result, the user can identify and analyze erroneous and suspicious measurements in the network.

EuroVis,2014,Visual Analysis of Sets of Heterogeneous Matrices Using Projection-Based Distance Functions and Semantic Zoom,10.1111/cgf.12397,"AbstractMatrix visualization is an established technique in the analysis of relational data. It is applicable to large, dense networks, where node‐link representations may not be effective. Recently, domains have emerged in which the comparative analysis of sets of matrices of potentially varying size is relevant. For example, to monitor computer network traffic a dynamic set of hosts and their peer‐to‐peer connections on different ports must be analysed. A matrix visualization focused on the display of one matrix at a time cannot cope with this task.We address the research problem of the visual analysis of sets of matrices. We present a technique for comparing matrices of potentially varying size. Our approach considers the rows and/or columns of a matrix as the basic elements of the analysis. We project these vectors for pairs of matrices into a low‐dimensional space which is used as the reference to compare matrices and identify relationships among them. Bipartite graph matching is applied on the projected elements to compute a measure of distance. A key advantage of this measure is that it can be interpreted and manipulated as a visual distance function, and serves as a comprehensible basis for ranking, clustering and comparison in sets of matrices. We present an interactive system in which users may explore the matrix distances and understand potential differences in a set of matrices. A flexible semantic zoom mechanism enables users to navigate through sets of matrices and identify patterns at different levels of detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study and provide a technical evaluation to illustrate its strengths.",Michael Behrisch 0001;James Davey;Fabian Fischer 0001;Olivier Thonnard;Tobias Schreck;Daniel A.

EuroVis,2013,Evaluating Isosurfaces with Level-set-based Information Maps,10.1111/cgf.12087,"AbstractWhile isosurfaces have been widely used for scalar data visualization, it is often difficult to determine if the selected isosurfaces for visualization are sufficient to represent the entire scalar field. In this paper, we present an information‐theoretic approach to evaluate the representativeness of a given isosurface set. Our basic idea is that given two isosurfaces that enclose a subvolume, if the intermediate isosurfaces in the subvolume can be generated by smoothly morphing from one isosurface to the other, no additional isosurfaces are needed since the geometry of the true isosurfaces within the subvolume can be easily inferred. To realize this idea, given a pair of isosurfaces, to determine if such a smooth condition in the enclosed region is satisfied, we use a level‐set approach to generate the intermediate surfaces. On each intermediate surface, we sample the values from the scalar field and exam the distribution. If the entropy of the distribution is low, this intermediate surface is aligned well with a true isosurface in the scalar field. For the intermediate surfaces generated by the level‐set method from the boundary isosurfaces, the distributions of scalar values from the level‐set surfaces form a 2D distribution, called isosurface information map. This information map can be used as an indicator of the representativeness of the boundary isosurfaces for the data in the subregion, allowing a quantitative measurement of information representable by the input isosurfaces. Based on this information‐theoretic approach, this paper presents an isosurface selection algorithm that can automatically select isosurfaces for more effective visualization of scalar fields.",Tzu-Hsuan Wei;Teng-Yok Lee;Han-Wei Shen,

We discuss some fundamental problems with the previous algorithms and describe a new approach, based on merging grid cubes near sharp edges, that produces significantly better results. Our algorithm requires only gradients at the grid vertices, not at each surface‐edge intersection point.

EuroVis,2013,Progressive High-Quality Response Surfaces for Visually Guided Sensitivity Analysis,10.1111/cgf.12089,"AbstractIn this paper we present a technique which allows us to perform high quality and progressive response surface prediction from multidimensional input samples in an efficient manner. We utilize kriging interpolation to estimate a response surface which minimizes the expectation value and variance of the prediction error. High computational efficiency is achieved by employing parallel matrix and vector operations on the GPU. Our approach differs from previous kriging approaches in that it uses a novel progressive updating scheme for new samples based on blockwise matrix inversion. In this way we can handle very large sample sets to which new samples are continually added. Furthermore, we can monitor the incremental evolution of the surface, providing a means to early terminate the computation when no significant changes have occurred. When the generation of input samples is fast enough, our technique enables steering this generation process interactively to find relevant dependency relations.",Ismail Demir;Rüdiger Westermann,
EuroVis,2013,Evolutionary Visual Exploration: Evaluation With Expert Users,10.1111/cgf.12090,"AbstractWe present an Evolutionary Visual Exploration (EVE) system that combines visual analytics with stochastic optimisation to aid the exploration of multidimensional datasets characterised by a large number of possible views or projections. Starting from dimensions whose values are automatically calculated by a PCA, an interactive evolutionary algorithm progressively builds (or evolves) non‐trivial viewpoints in the form of linear and non‐linear dimension combinations, to help users discover new interesting views and relationships in their data. The criteria for evolving new dimensions is not known a priori and are partially specified by the user via an interactive interface: (i) The user selects views with meaningful or interesting visual patterns and provides a satisfaction score. (ii) The system calibrates a fitness function (optimised by the evolutionary algorithm) to take into account the user input, and then calculates new views. Our method leverages automatic tools to detect interesting visual features and human interpretation to derive meaning, validate the findings and guide the exploration without having to grasp advanced statistical concepts. To validate our method, we built a prototype tool (EvoGraphDice) as an extension of an existing scatterplot matrix inspection tool, and conducted an observational study with five domain experts. Our results show that EvoGraphDice can help users quantify qualitative hypotheses and try out different scenarios to dynamically transform their data. Importantly, it allowed our experts to think laterally, better formulate their research questions and build new hypotheses for further investigation.",Nadia Boukhelifa;Waldo Cancino Ticona;Anastasia Bezerianos;Evelyne Lutton,

To mitigate this, we present EvalBench, an easy‐to‐use, flexible, and reusable software library for visualization evaluation written in Java.

EuroVis,2013,Evaluation of Attention-Guiding Video Visualization,10.1111/cgf.12092,"AbstractWe investigate four different variants of attention‐guiding video visualization techniques that aim to help users distribute their attention equally among potential objects of interest: bounding box visualization, force‐directed visualization, top‐down visualization, grid visualization. Objects of interest are highlighted by rectangular shapes and then we concentrate on the manipulation of color, motion, and size. We conducted a controlled laboratory user study (n=25) to compare the four visualization techniques and the unmodified video material as baseline. We evaluated task performance and distribution of attention in a search task. These two properties become especially important when video material with numerous objects has to be observed. The distribution of attention was measured by eye tracking. Our results show that a more even distribution of attention between the objects can be achieved by attention‐guiding visualization, compared to unmodified video. Many participants feel more comfortable when they look at bounding boxes and the grid, but improvements in search task performance could not be confirmed.",Kuno Kurzhals;Markus Höferlin;Daniel Weiskopf,
EuroVis,2013,Visual Analysis of Set Relations in a Graph,10.1111/cgf.12093,"AbstractMany applications can be modeled as a graph with additional attributes attached to the nodes. For example, a graph can be used to model the relationship of people in a social media website or a bibliographical dataset. Meanwhile, additional information is often available, such as the topics people are interested in and the music they listen to. Based on this additional information, different set relationships may exist among people. Revealing the set relationships in a network can help people gain social insight and better understand their roles within a community. In this paper, we present a visualization system for exploring set relations in a graph. Our system is designed to reveal three different relationships simultaneously: the social relationship of people, the set relationship among people's items of interest, and the similarity relationship of the items. We propose two novel visualization designs: a) a glyph‐based visualization to reveal people's set relationships in the context of their social networks; b) an integration of visual links and a contour map to show people and their items of interest which are clustered into different groups. The effectiveness of the designs has been demonstrated by the case studies on two representative datasets including one from a social music service website and another from an academic collaboration network.",Panpan Xu;Fan Du;Nan Cao;Conglei Shi;Hong Zhou 0004;Huamin Qu,
EuroVis,2013,Maximum Entropy Summary Trees,10.1111/cgf.12094,"AbstractGiven a very large, node‐weighted, rooted tree on, say, n nodes, if one has only enough space to display a k‐node summary of the tree, what is the most informative way to draw the tree? We define a type of weighted tree that we call a summary tree of the original tree that results from aggregating nodes of the original tree subject to certain constraints. We suggest that the best choice of which summary tree to use (among those with a fixed number of nodes) is the one that maximizes the information‐theoretic entropy of a natural probability distribution associated with the summary tree, and we provide a (pseudopolynomial‐time) dynamic‐programming algorithm to compute this maximum entropy summary tree, when the weights are integral. The result is an automated way to summarize large trees and retain as much information about them as possible, while using (and displaying) only a fraction of the original node set. We illustrate the computation and use of maximum entropy summary trees on five real data sets whose weighted tree representations vary widely in structure. We also provide an additive approximation algorithm and a greedy heuristic that are faster than the optimal algorithm, and generalize to trees with real‐valued weights.",Howard J. Karloff;Kenneth E.

EuroVis,2013,VisRuption: Intuitive and Efficient Visualization of Temporal Airline Disruption Data,10.1111/cgf.12095,"AbstractThe operation of an airline is a very complex task and disruptions to the planned operation can occur on very short notice. Already a small disruption like a delay of some minutes can cost the airline a tremendous amount of money. Hence, it is crucial to proactively control all operations of the airline and efficiently prioritize and handle disruptions. Due to the complex setting and the need for ad hoc decisions this task can only be carried out by human operation controllers. In the field of airline operations control there exists already a vast variety of different software in productive use. We analyze the different approaches from two of the market leaders and identify problematic design choices. We take into account this analysis and develop a set of rules for an intuitive visualization of airline disruption data. Finally, we introduce our tool for visualizing such data which complies to these rules. The visualization enables the user to gain a fast overview over the current problem situation and to intuitively prioritize different problems and problem hierarchies.

These steps can easily be interleaved and the comparison of different workflows is explicitly supported. We took special care to contain the exponential expansion of possible on/off combinations by creating a novel querying interface. An interactive heat map facilitates the exploration and comparison of different clusters.

EuroVis,2013,HiFiVE: A Hilbert Space Embedding of Fiber Variability Estimates for Uncertainty Modeling and Visualization,10.1111/cgf.12099,"AbstractObtaining reproducible fiber direction estimates from diffusion MRI is crucial for successful fiber tracking. Modeling and visualizing the probability distribution of the inferred fiber directions is an important step in evaluating and comparing different acquisition schemes and fiber models. However, this distribution is usually strongly dominated by its main direction, which makes it difficult to examine when plotted naively.In this work, we propose a new visualization of the fiber probability distribution. It is based on embedding the probability measure into a particular reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This permits a decomposition into an embedded delta peak, representing the main direction, and a non‐negative residual. They are then combined into a new glyph representation which visually enhances the residual, in order to highlight even subtle differences. Moreover, the magnitude of the delta peak component quantifies precision of the main fiber direction. We demonstrate that our new glyph provides a more detailed impression of the uncertainty than the current standard method, cones that contain 95% of the estimated directions. We use our new method to contribute to the validation of different ways of resampling the data (bootstrapping), and to visualize the differences between alternative acquisition schemes and models for high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI).",Thomas Schultz 0001;Lara Schlaffke;Bernhard Schölkopf;Tobias Schmidt-Wilcke,
EuroVis,2013,Nonparametric Models for Uncertainty Visualization,10.1111/cgf.12100,"AbstractAn uncertain (scalar, vector, tensor) field is usually perceived as a discrete random field with a priori unknown probability distributions. To compute derived probabilities, e.g. for the occurrence of certain features, an appropriate probabilistic model has to be selected. The majority of previous approaches in uncertainty visualization were restricted to Gaussian fields. In this paper we extend these approaches to nonparametric models, which are much more flexible, as they can represent various types of distributions, including multimodal and skewed ones. We present three examples of nonparametric representations: (a) empirical distributions, (b) histograms and (c) kernel density estimates (KDE). While the first is a direct representation of the ensemble data, the latter two use reconstructed probability density functions of continuous random variables. For KDE we propose an approach to compute valid consistent marginal distributions and to efficiently capture correlations using a principal component transformation. Furthermore, we use automatic bandwidth selection, obtaining a model for probabilistic local feature extraction. The methods are demonstrated by computing probabilities of level crossings, critical points and vortex cores in simulated biofluid dynamics and climate data.",Kai Pöthkow;Hans-Christian Hege,

We introduce an animation‐based interactive visualization technique for the analysis of communication patterns occurring in parallel application execution. Our method has the advantages of illustrating the dynamic communication patterns in the system as well as a static image of MPI (Message Passing Interface) utilization history.

In this paper, we exploit the special properties of the TA factor matrix bases and define a novel multiscale and multiresolution volume rendering hierarchy. Different from previous approaches, to represent one volume dataset we use but one set of global bases (TA factor matrices) to reconstruct at all resolution levels and feature scales.

A more detailed case study with complex and noisy data from a psychological experiment then demonstrates how basic design ideas for gestaltlines can be applied in less controlled, and thus more realistic, situations.

Our scale‐stack bar charts use multiple scales to cover a large value range, while the linear mapping within each scale preserves the ability to visually compare quantitative ratios. Scale‐stack bar charts can be used for the same applications as classic bar charts; in particular, they can readily handle stacked bar representations and negative values.

As proof of concept the exploration method is implemented in a prototype. The effectiveness of the exploration method is tested using a formal user study comparing four different interaction methods. By using Small Multiples as data exploration method users need fewer steps in answering questions and also explore a significantly larger part of the state space in the same amount of time, providing them with a broader perspective on the data, hence lowering the chance of missing important features.

This includes critical processes, such as dust particles interacting with aircraft (e.g., brown‐or white‐out effects) and particle separation based on density variation. In this paper, we contribute a generalized description of mass‐dependent particle trajectories and apply existing unsteady flow visualization methods to the mass‐dependent case. This comprises the extension of common concepts, i.e., path lines, streak lines, and time lines. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of integral curves, called mass lines that effectively visualizes mass separation and captures mass‐related features in unsteady flow fields that are inaccessible using traditional methods.

EuroVis,2013,Visualizing Robustness of Critical Points for 2D Time-Varying Vector Fields,10.1111/cgf.12109,"AbstractAnalyzing critical points and their temporal evolutions plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of vector fields. A key challenge is to quantify the stability of critical points: more stable points may represent more important phenomena or vice versa. The topological notion of robustness is a tool which allows us to quantify rigorously the stability of each critical point. Intuitively, the robustness of a critical point is the minimum amount of perturbation necessary to cancel it within a local neighborhood, measured under an appropriate metric. In this paper, we introduce a new analysis and visualization framework which enables interactive exploration of robustness of critical points for both stationary and time‐varying 2D vector fields. This framework allows the end‐users, for the first time, to investigate how the stability of a critical point evolves over time. We show that this depends heavily on the global properties of the vector field and that structural changes can correspond to interesting behavior. We demonstrate the practicality of our theories and techniques on several datasets involving combustion and oceanic eddy simulations and obtain some key insights regarding their stable and unstable features.",Bei Wang 0001;Paul Rosen 0001;Primoz Skraba;Harsh Bhatia;Valerio Pascucci,

EuroVis,2013,Comparative Visualization of Tracer Uptake in In Vivo Small Animal PET/CT Imaging of the Carotid Arteries,10.1111/cgf.12111,"AbstractCardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in the western world. Medical research on atherosclerosis is therefore of great interest and a very active research topic. We present a visualization system that supports scientists in exploring plaque development and evaluating the applicability of PET tracers for early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In our application case a cone shaped cuff has been implanted around the carotid artery of ApoE knockout mice, fed with a high cholesterol western type diet. As a result, vascular lesions develop upstream and downstream from the cuff. Tracer uptake induced by these lesions needs to be analyzed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of different PET tracers. We discuss the approach previously utilized to perform this kind of analysis, the problems arising from in vivo image acquisition (in contrast to ex vivo) and the design process of our application. In close cooperation with domain experts we have developed new visualization techniques that display PET activity in the vessel wall and surrounding tissue in a single image. We use the vessel wall detected in the CT image to perform a normalized circular projection which allows the user to judge PET signal distribution in relation to the deformed vessel. Based on this projection a quantitative analysis of a defined region adjacent to the vessel wall can be performed and compared to the artery without the cuff.",Stefan Diepenbrock;Sven Hermann;Michael Schäfers 0001;Michael Kuhlmann;Klaus H.

EuroVis,2013,AmniVis - A System for Qualitative Exploration of Near-Wall Hemodynamics in Cerebral Aneurysms,10.1111/cgf.12112,"AbstractThe qualitative exploration of near‐wall hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms provides important insights for risk assessment. For instance, a direct relation between complex flow patterns and aneurysm formation could be observed. Due to the high complexity of the underlying time‐dependent flow data, the exploration is challenging, in particular for medical researchers not familiar with such data. We present the AmniVis‐Explorer, a system that is designed for the preparation of a qualitative medical study. The provided features were developed in close collaboration with medical researchers involved in the study. This comprises methods for a purposeful selection of surface regions of interest and a novel approach to provide a 2D overview of flow patterns that are represented by streamlines at these regions. Furthermore, we present a specialized interface that supports binary classification of patterns and temporal exploration as well as methods for selection, highlighting and automatic 3D navigation to particular patterns. Based on eight representative datasets, we conducted informal interviews with two bord‐certified radiologists and a flow expert to evaluate the system. It was confirmed that the AmniVis‐Explorer allows for an easy selection, qualitative exploration and classification of near‐wall flow patterns that are represented by streamlines.",Mathias Neugebauer;Kai Lawonn;Oliver Beuing;Philipp Berg;Gábor Janiga;Bernhard Preim,
EuroVis,2013,Spatially Efficient Design of Annotated Metro Maps,10.1111/cgf.12113,"AbstractAnnotating metro maps with thumbnail photographs is a commonly used technique for guiding travelers. However, conventional methods usually suffer from small labeling space around the metro stations especially when they are interchange stations served by two or more metro lines. This paper presents an approach for aesthetically designing schematic metro maps while ensuring effective placement of large annotation labels that are sufficiently close to their corresponding stations. Our idea is to distribute such labels in a well‐balanced manner to labeling regions around the metro network first and then adjust the lengths of metro line and leader line segments, which allows us to fully maximize the space coverage of the entire annotated map. This is accomplished by incorporating additional constraints into the conventional mixed‐integer programming formulation, while we devised a three‐step algorithm for accelerating the overall optimization process. We include several design examples to demonstrate the spatial efficiency of the map layout generated using the proposed approach through minimal user intervention.",Hsiang-Yun Wu;Shigeo Takahashi;Daichi Hirono;Masatoshi Arikawa;Chun-Cheng Lin;Hsu-Chun Yen,

They are a highly valuable means not only for unveiling human mobility patterns, but also for assisting transportation planning, in particular for metropolises around the world. In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of visualizing and analyzing massive movement data, i.e., the interchange pattern, aiming at revealing passenger redistribution in a traffic network. We first formulate a new model of circos figure, namely the interchange circos diagram, to present interchange patterns at a junction node in a bundled fashion, and optimize the color assignments to respect the connections within and between junction nodes. Based on this, we develop a family of visual analysis techniques to help users interactively study interchange patterns in a spatiotemporal manner: 1) multi‐spatial scales: from network junctions such as train stations to people flow across and between larger spatial areas; and 2) temporal changes of patterns from different times of the day. Our techniques have been applied to real movement data consisting of hundred thousands of trips, and we present also two case studies on how transportation experts worked with our interface.",Wei Zeng 0004;Chi-Wing Fu;Stefan Müller Arisona;Huamin Qu,

In particular, the traditional eye gaze plots of scan paths fail for a large number of study participants since these plots lead to much visual clutter. To address this problem we introduce the AOI Rivers technique as a novel interactive visualization method for investigating time‐varying fixation frequencies, transitions between areas of interest (AOIs), and the sequential order of gaze visits to AOIs in a visual stimulus of an eye tracking experiment. To this end, we extend the ThemeRiver technique by influents, effluents, and transitions similar to the concept of Sankey diagrams. The AOI Rivers visualization is complemented by linked spatial views of the data in the form of heatmaps, gaze plots, or display of the visual stimulus. The usefulness of our technique is demonstrated for gaze trajectory data recorded in a previously conducted eye tracking experiment.",Michael Burch;Andreas Kull;Daniel Weiskopf,
EuroVis,2013,User-driven Feature Space Transformation,10.1111/cgf.12116,"AbstractInteractive visualization systems for exploring and manipulating high‐dimensional feature spaces have experienced a substantial progress in the last few years. State‐of‐art methods rely on solid mathematical and computational foundations that enable sophisticated and flexible interactive tools. Current methods are even capable of modifying data attributes during interaction, highlighting regions of potential interest in the feature space, and building visualizations that bring out the relevance of attributes. However, those methodologies rely on complex and non‐intuitive interfaces that hamper the free handling of the feature spaces. Moreover, visualizing how neighborhood structures are affected during the space manipulation is also an issue for existing methods. This paper presents a novel visualization‐assisted methodology for interacting and transforming data attributes embedded in feature spaces. The proposed approach relies on a combination of multidimensional projections and local transformations to provide an interactive mechanism for modifying attributes. Besides enabling a simple and intuitive visual layout, our approach allows the user to easily observe the changes in neighborhood structures during interaction.

EuroVis,2013,Continuous Representation of Projected Attribute Spaces of Multifields over Any Spatial Sampling,10.1111/cgf.12117,"AbstractFor the visual analysis of multidimensional data, dimension reduction methods are commonly used to project to a lower‐dimensional visual space. In the context of multifields, i.e., volume data with a multidimensional attribute space, the spatial arrangement of the samples in the volumetric domain can be exploited to generate a Continuous Representation of the Projected Attribute Space (CoRPAS). Here, the sample locations in the volumetric domain may be arranged in a structured or unstructured way and may or may not be connected by a grid or a mesh. We propose an approach to generate CoRPAS for any sample arrangement using an isotropic density function. An interactive visual exploration system with three coordinated views of volume visualization, CoRPAS, and an interaction widget based on star coordinates is presented. The star‐coordinates widget provides an intuitive means for the user to change the projection matrix. The coordinated views allow for feature selection in form of brushing and linking. The approach is applied to both synthetic data and data resulting from numerical simulations of physical phenomena. In particular, simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are addressed, where the simulation kernel can be used to produce a CoRPAS that is consistent with the simulation. We also show how a logarithmic scaling of attribute values in CoRPAS is supported, which is of high practical relevance.",Vladimir Molchanov;Alexey Fofonov;Lars Linsen,
EuroVis,2013,Visualizing Motional Correlations in Molecular Dynamics using Geometric Deformations,10.1111/cgf.12118,"AbstractIn macromolecules, an allosteric effect is said to occur when a change at one site of a molecule affects a distant site. Understanding these allosteric effects can be important for understanding how the functions of complex molecules such as proteins are regulated. One potential application of this knowledge is the development of small molecules that alter the function of proteins involved in diseases. Studying motional correlation can help researchers to discover how a change at a source site affects the target site and thus how allosteric ligands that could serve as drugs are able to exert their therapeutic effects. By improving our ability to analyze these correlated relationships, it may be possible to develop new medications to combat deadly diseases such as Hepatitis C. We present four visual techniques which represent motional correlation on rendered three‐dimensional molecular models, providing new ways to view clusters of correlated residues and paths of allosteric interactions. These techniques give us a new way of investigating the presence of motional correlations in complex molecules.

EuroVis,2013,Streamlines for Illustrative Real-Time Rendering,10.1111/cgf.12119,"AbstractLine drawing techniques are important methods to illustrate shapes. Existing feature line methods, e.g., suggestive contours, apparent ridges, or photic extremum lines, solely determine salient regions and illustrate them with separate lines. Hatching methods convey the shape by drawing a wealth of lines on the whole surface. Both approaches are often not sufficient for a faithful visualization of organic surface models, e.g., in biology or medicine. In this paper, we present a novel object‐space line drawing algorithm that conveys the shape of such surface models in real‐time. Our approach employs contour‐ and feature‐based illustrative streamlines to convey surface shape (ConFIS). For every triangle, precise streamlines are calculated on the surface with a given curvature vector field. Salient regions are detected by determining maxima and minima of a scalar field. Compared with existing feature lines and hatching methods, ConFIS uses the advantages of both categories in an effective and flexible manner. We demonstrate this with different anatomical and artificial surface models. In addition, we conducted a qualitative evaluation of our technique to compare our results with exemplary feature line and hatching methods.",Kai Lawonn;Tobias Mönch;Bernhard Preim,

The automated analysis process is performed in real time while the user interactively explores a dynamic data set. The system supports linking and brushing to allow for a user‐guided visual analysis based on different aspects of the data.

We show that our concepts are useful to data analysis on real‐world examples originating from fluid‐flow simulations; in two cases where the consensus of multiple scalar vortex predictors is of interest and in another case where one predictor is studied under different simulation parameters.

EuroVis,2013,dPSO-Vis: Topology-based Visualization of Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization,10.1111/cgf.12122,"AbstractParticle swarm optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic that has been applied successfully to many continuous and combinatorial optimization problems, e.g., in the fields of economics, engineering, and natural sciences. In PSO, a swarm of particles moves within a search space in order to find an optimal solution. Unfortunately, it is hard to understand in detail why and how changes in the design of PSO algorithms affect the optimization behavior. Visualizing the particle states could provide substantially better insight into PSO algorithms. Though in case of combinatorial optimization problems, it often raises the problem of illustrating the states within the discrete search space that cannot be embedded spatially. We propose a visualization approach to depict the optimization problem topologically using a landscape metaphor. This visualization is augmented by an illustration of the time‐dependent states of the particles. Thus, the user of dPSO‐Vis is able to analyze the swarm's behavior within the search space. In principle, our method can be used for any optimization algorithm where a swarm of individuals searches within a discrete search space.

We use a duality argument to define the cells of the descending Morse complex in terms of the supplied (primal) tetrahedral mesh and those of the ascending complex in terms of its dual mesh. The Morse‐Smale complex is then described combinatorially as collections of cells from the intersection of the primal and dual meshes. We introduce a simple compact encoding for discrete vector fields attached to the mesh tetrahedra that is suitable for combination with any topological data structure encoding just the vertices and tetrahedra of the mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach over large unstructured tetrahedral meshes by developing algorithms for computing the discrete gradient field and for extracting the cells of the Morse and Morse‐Smale complexes.

In this paper we explore means to show the relationships between the characters of a plot and at the same time their development over the course of a novel. Based on a careful exploration of the design space, we suggest a new visualization technique called Fingerprint Matrices.

We focus on a symmetric pattern of multiple coordinated views, cross‐filtered views, that involves only nominal/categorical data. We describe a study of the effects of pairing a visualization with a Q2Q interface on several aspects of usability. Q2Q produces considerable improvements in learnability, efficiency, and memorability of visualization in terms of speed and the length of interaction sequences that users follow, along with a modest decrease in error ratio. From a visual language perspective, we analyze how Q2Q speeds up users’ comprehension of interaction, particularly when a visualization representation has deficiencies in illustrating hidden items or relationships.",Maryam Nafari;Chris E.

Given a set of categorical values and a target color palette, our algorithm matches each data value with a unique color. Values are mapped to colors by collecting representative images, analyzing image color distributions to determine value‐color affinity scores, and choosing an optimal assignment. Our affinity score balances the probability of a color with how well it discriminates among data values. A controlled study shows that expert‐chosen semantically‐resonant colors improve speed on chart reading tasks compared to a standard palette, and that our algorithm selects colors that lead to similar gains. A second study verifies that our algorithm effectively selects colors across a variety of data categories.",Sharon Lin;Julie Fortuna;Chinmay Kulkarni 0001;Maureen C. Stone;Jeffrey Heer,

Analysts might be interested only in movements that occur in a given time range, traverse a certain region, or end at a given area of interest (AOI). Our lenses can be placed on an interactive map to identify such geospatial AOIs. They can be grouped with set operations to create powerful geospatial queries.

In this paper, we present a new method for efficient ray casting of geodesic girds by leveraging the power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). A geodesic grid can be directly fetched from storage or streamed from simulations to the rendering stage without the need of any intermediate grid transformation.

However, to adapt visualization to different contexts and contents and to support saliency‐guided visualization based on user interaction or dynamically changing thematic information, a combination of different graphic styles is necessary. Design and implementation of such combined graphic styles pose a number of challenges, specifically from the perspective of real‐time 3D visualization.

In our approach, we first use procedural noise to create an initial spot pattern on the surface that has both an almost constant screen space frequency and is view independent.

EuroVis,2012,Illustrative Membrane Clipping,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03083.x,"AbstractClipping is a fast, common technique for resolving occlusions. It only requires simple interaction, is easily understandable, and thus has been very popular for volume exploration. However, a drawback of clipping is that the technique indiscriminately cuts through features. Illustrators, for example, consider the structures in the vicinity of the cut when visualizing complex spatial data and make sure that smaller structures near the clipping plane are kept in the image and not cut into fragments. In this paper we present a new technique, which combines the simple clipping interaction with automated selective feature preservation using an elastic membrane. In order to prevent cutting objects near the clipping plane, the deformable membrane uses underlying data properties to adjust itself to salient structures. To achieve this behaviour, we translate data attributes into a potential field which acts on the membrane, thus moving the problem of deformation into the soft‐body dynamics domain.

For manual adjustment, the user can insert additional potential fields, as well as pinning the membrane to interesting areas.

EuroVis,2012,Scalable Detection of Spatiotemporal Encounters in Historical Movement Data,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03084.x,"AbstractThe widespread adoption of location‐aware devices is resulting in the generation of large amounts of spatiotemporal movement data, collected and stored in digital repositories. This forms a fertile ground for domain experts and scientists to analyze such historical data and discover interesting movement behavioral patterns. Experts in many domains, such as transportation, logistics and retail, are interested in detecting and understanding movement patterns and behavior of objects in relation to each other. Their insights can point to optimization potential and reveal deviations from planned behavior. In this paper, we focus on the detection of the encounter patterns as one possible type in movement behavior. These patterns refer to objects being close to one another in terms of space and time. We define scalability as a core requirement when dealing with historical movement data, in order to allow the domain expert to set parameters of the encounter detection algorithm. Our approach leverages a designated data structure and requires only a single pass over chronological data, thus resulting in highly scalable and fast technique to detect encounters. Consequently, users are able to explore their data by interactively specifying the spatial and temporal windows that define encounters. We evaluate our proposed method as a function of its input parameters and data size. We instantiate the proposed method on urban public transportation data, where we found a large number of encounters. We show that single encounters emerge into higher level patterns that are of particular interest and value to the domain.",Peter Bak;Mattias Marder;Sivan Harary;Avi Yaeli;Harold J. Ship,
EuroVis,2012,Travel-Route-Centered Metro Map Layout and Annotation,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03085.x,"AbstractWhen providing travel guides for a specific route in a metro network, we often place the route around the center of the map and annotate stations on the route with thumbnail photographs. Nonetheless, existing methods do not offer an effective means of customizing the network layout in order to accommodate such large annotation labels while preserving its planar embedding. This paper presents a new approach for designing the metro map layout in order to annotate stations on a specific travel route with large annotation labels. Our idea is to elongate the travel route to be straight along the centerline of the map so that we can systematically annotate such stations with external labels. This is accomplished by extending the conventional mixed‐integer programming technique for computing octilinear layouts where orientations inherent to the metro line segments are plausibly rearranged. The stations are then connected with external labels through leaders while minimizing intersections with metro lines for enhancing visual clarity. We present several design examples of metro maps and user studies to demonstrate that the proposed aesthetic criteria successfully direct viewers’ attention to specific travel routes.",Hsiang-Yun Wu;Shigeo Takahashi;Chun-Cheng Lin;Hsu-Chun Yen,

We introduce the World's Languages Explorer, which provides the required functionalities in one single Visual Analytics environment. Contributions are made for different parts of the system: We introduce an extended Sunburst visualization whose so‐called feature‐rings allow for a cross‐comparison of a large number of features at once, within the hierarchical context of the language genealogy. We suggest a mapping of homogeneity measures to all levels of the hierarchy. In addition, we suggest an integration of information from the areal data space into the hierarchical data space. With our approach we bring Visual Analytics research to a new application field, namely Historical Comparative Linguistics, and Linguistic and Areal Typology.

EuroVis,2012,A Quantized Boundary Representation of 2D Flows,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03087.x,"AbstractAnalysis and visualization of complex vector fields remain major challenges when studying large scale simulation of physical phenomena. The primary reason is the gap between the concepts of smooth vector field theory and their computational realization. In practice, researchers must choose between either numerical techniques, with limited or no guarantees on how they preserve fundamental invariants, or discrete techniques which limit the precision at which the vector field can be represented. We propose a new representation of vector fields that combines the advantages of both approaches. In particular, we represent a subset of possible streamlines by storing their paths as they traverse the edges of a triangulation. Using only a finite set of streamlines creates a fully discrete version of a vector field that nevertheless approximates the smooth flow up to a user controlled error bound. The discrete nature of our representation enables us to directly compute and classify analogues of critical points, closed orbits, and other common topological structures. Further, by varying the number of divisions (quantizations) used per edge, we vary the resolution used to represent the field, allowing for controlled precision. This representation is compact in memory and supports standard vector field operations.",Joshua A. Levine;Shreeraj Jadhav;Harsh Bhatia;Valerio Pascucci;Peer-Timo Bremer,

In addition, due to absence of divergence, they feature only a subset of invariant structures from traditional vector field topology. For magnetic fields of sets of point dipoles—widely present in physics and often used as an approximation—we present a technique revealing the topology of magnetic flux. The flux topology is identified with areas covered by field lines that directly connect pairs of dipoles. We introduce the dipole connectrix as a reduced one‐manifold representation of those areas. The set of connectrices serves as our concise visualization of the global structure of magnetic flux. In addition, the quantitative values of flux are displayed by the thickness of the connectrices.

This paper discusses scalable techniques to compute the Morse‐Smale complex of scalar functions defined on large three‐dimensional structured grids. Computing the Morse‐Smale complex of three‐dimensional domains is challenging as compared to two‐dimensional domains because of the non‐trivial structure introduced by the two types of saddle criticalities. We present a parallel shared‐memory algorithm to compute the Morse‐Smale complex based on Forman's discrete Morse theory. The algorithm achieves scalability via synergistic use of the CPU and the GPU. We first prove that the discrete gradient on the domain can be computed independently for each cell and hence can be implemented on the GPU. Second, we describe a two‐step graph traversal algorithm to compute the 1‐saddle‐2‐saddle connections efficiently and in parallel on the CPU. Simultaneously, the extremasaddle connections are computed using a tree traversal algorithm on the GPU.",Nithin Shivashankar;Vijay Natarajan,
EuroVis,2012,Drawing Large Graphs by Low-Rank Stress Majorization,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03090.x,"AbstractOptimizing a stress model is a natural technique for drawing graphs: one seeks an embedding into Rd which best preserves the induced graph metric. Current approaches to solving the stress model for a graph with |𝒱| nodes and |ɛ| edges require the full all‐pairs shortest paths (APSP) matrix, which takes O(|𝒱|2 log |ɛ|+|𝒱‖ɛ|) time and O(|𝒱|2) space. We propose a novel algorithm based on a low‐rank approximation to the required matrices. The crux of our technique is an observation that it is possible to approximate the full APSP matrix, even when only a small subset of its entries are known. Our algorithm takes time O(k|𝒱|+|𝒱|log|𝒱|+|ɛ|) per iteration with a preprocessing time of O(k3+ k(|ɛ|+|𝒱| log |𝒱|) + k2|𝒱|) and memory usage of O(k|𝒱|), where a user‐defined parameter k trades off quality of approximation with running time and space.

EuroVis,2012,Using Signposts for Navigation in Large Graphs,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03091.x,"AbstractIn this paper we present a new Focus &amp; Context technique for the exploration of large, abstract graphs. Most Focus &amp; Context techniques present context in a visual way. In contrast, our technique uses a symbolic representation: while the focus is a set of visible nodes, labelled signposts provide cues for the context — off‐screen regions of the graph — and indicate the direction of the shortest path linking the visible nodes to these regions. We show how the regions are defined and how they are selected dynamically, depending on the visible nodes. To define the set of visible nodes we use an approach developed by van Ham and Perer that dynamically extracts a subgraph based on an initial focal node and a degree‐of‐interest function. This approach is extended to support multiple focal nodes. With the symbolic visualization, potentially interesting regions of a graph may be represented with a very small visual footprint. We conclude the paper with an initial user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the signposts for navigation tasks.",Thorsten May;Martin Steiger;James Davey;Jörn Kohlhammer,
EuroVis,2012,Comparative Evaluation of an Interactive Time-Series Visualization that Combines Quantitative Data with Qualitative Abstractions,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03092.x,"AbstractIn many application areas, analysts have to make sense of large volumes of multivariate time‐series data. Explorative analysis of this kind of data is often difficult and overwhelming at the level of raw data. Temporal data abstraction reduces data complexity by deriving qualitative statements that reflect domain‐specific key characteristics. Visual representations of abstractions and raw data together with appropriate interaction methods can support analysts in making their data easier to understand. Such a visualization technique that applies smooth semantic zooming has been developed in the context of patient data analysis. However, no empirical evidence on its effectiveness and efficiency is available. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by reporting on a controlled experiment that compares this technique with another visualization method used in the well‐known KNAVE‐II framework. Both methods integrate quantitative data with qualitative abstractions whereas the first one uses a composite representation with color‐coding to display the qualitative data and spatial position coding for the quantitative data. The second technique uses juxtaposed representations for quantitative and qualitative data with spatial position coding for both. Results show that the test persons using the composite representation were generally faster, particularly for more complex tasks that involve quantitative values as well as qualitative abstractions.",Wolfgang Aigner;Alexander Rind;Stephan Hoffmann,

We analyzed findings made by the study participants with flow maps, one of the most popular representations of spatial interactions, using animation and small‐multiples as two alternative ways of representing temporal changes. Our goal was not to measure the subjects’ performance with the two views, but to find out whether there are qualitative differences between the types of findings users make with these two representations. To achieve this goal we performed a deep analysis of the collected findings, the interaction logs, and the subjective feedback from the users. We observed that with animation the subjects tended to make more findings concerning geographically local events and changes between subsequent years. With small‐multiples more findings concerning longer time periods were made. Besides, our results suggest that switching from one view to the other might lead to an increase in the numbers of findings of specific types made by the subjects which can be beneficial for certain tasks.",Ilya Boyandin;Enrico Bertini;Denis Lalanne,
EuroVis,2012,Conceptualizing Visual Uncertainty in Parallel Coordinates,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03094.x,"AbstractUncertainty is an intrinsic part of any visual representation in visualization, no matter how precise the input data. Existing research on uncertainty in visualization mainly focuses on depicting data‐space uncertainty in a visual form. Uncertainty is thus often seen as a problem to deal with, in the data, and something to be avoided if possible. In this paper, we highlight the need for analyzing visual uncertainty in order to design more effective visual representations. We study various forms of uncertainty in the visual representation of parallel coordinates and propose a taxonomy for categorizing them. By building a taxonomy, we aim to identify different sources of uncertainty in the screen space and relate them to different effects of uncertainty upon the user. We examine the literature on parallel coordinates and apply our taxonomy to categorize various techniques for reducing uncertainty. In addition, we consider uncertainty from a different perspective by identifying cases where increasing certain forms of uncertainty may even be useful, with respect to task, data type and analysis scenario. This work suggests that uncertainty is a feature that can be both useful and problematic in visualization, and it is beneficial to augment an information visualization pipeline with a facility for visual uncertainty analysis.",Aritra Dasgupta;Min Chen 0001;Robert Kosara,
EuroVis,2012,Visualization of Global Correlation Structures in Uncertain 2D Scalar Fields,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03095.x,"AbstractVisualizing correlations, i.e., the tendency of uncertain data values at different spatial positions to change contrarily or according to each other, allows inferring on the possible variations of structures in the data. Visualizing global correlation structures, however, is extremely challenging, since it is not clear how the visualization of complicated long‐range dependencies can be integrated into standard visualizations of spatial data. Furthermore, storing correlation information imposes a memory requirement that is quadratic in the number of spatial sample positions. This paper presents a novel approach for visualizing both positive and inverse global correlation structures in uncertain 2D scalar fields, where the uncertainty is modeled via a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We introduce a new measure for the degree of dependency of a random variable on its local and global surroundings, and we propose a spatial clustering approach based on this measure to classify regions of a particular correlation strength. The clustering performs a correlation filtering, which results in a representation that is only linear in the number of spatial sample points. Via cluster coloring the correlation information can be embedded into visualizations of other statistical quantities, such as the mean and the standard deviation. We finally propose a hierarchical cluster subdivision scheme to further allow for the simultaneous visualization of local and global correlations.",Tobias Pfaffelmoser;Rüdiger Westermann,

For this, we generalize the concepts of the most common vortex detectors to uncertain vector fields, namely the λ2‐criterion, Q‐criterion, and the concept of parallel vectors at the example of the method by Sujudi and Haimes. All these methods base on the computation of derivatives of the uncertain vector field which are uncertain fields as well. Since they generally cannot be computed in a closed form, we provide a Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the respective probability distributions. Based on this, uncertain versions of vortex regions and core structures are introduced.

While in a crisp field local features are either present or absent at some location, in an uncertain field they are present with some probability. We model sampled uncertain vector fields by discrete Gaussian random fields with empirically estimated spatial correlations. The variability of the random fields in a spatial neighborhood is characterized by marginal distributions. Probabilities for the presence of local features are formulated in terms of low‐dimensional integrals over such marginal distributions. Specifically, we define probabilistic equivalents for critical points and vortex cores. The probabilities are computed by Monte Carlo integration. For identification of critical points and cores of swirling motion we employ the Poincaré index and the criterion by Sujudi and Haimes. In contrast to previous global methods we take a local perspective and directly extract features in divergence‐free fields as well. The method is able to detect saddle points in a straight forward way and works on various grid types.

Vascular trees are usually described using centerlines, since they capture both the topology and the geometry of the vasculature in an intuitive manner. State‐of‐the‐art vessel segmentation algorithms deliver vascular outlines as free‐form contours along the centerline, since this allows capturing anatomical pathologies. However, existing methods for generating surface representations from centerlines can only cope with circular outlines. We present a novel model‐based technique that is capable of generating intersection‐free surfaces from centerlines with complex outlines. Vascular segments are described by local signed distance functions and combined using Boolean operations. An octree‐based surface generation strategy automatically computes watertight, scale‐adaptive meshes with a controllable quality.

An important example is found in the analysis of unsteady blood‐flow data. Preclinical research strives for a better understanding of correlations between the hemodynamics and the progression of cardiovascular diseases. Modern‐day computer models and MRI acquisition provide time‐resolved volumetric blood‐flow velocity fields. Unfortunately, these fields often remain unexplored, as high‐dimensional data are difficult to conceive. We present a spatiotemporal, i.e., four‐dimensional, hierarchical clustering, yielding a sparse representation of the velocity data. The clustering results underpin an illustrative visualization approach, facilitating visual analysis. The hierarchy allows an intuitive level‐of‐detail selection, largely retaining important flow patterns. The clustering employs dissimilarity measures to construct the hierarchy. We have adapted two existing measures for steady vector fields for use in the spacetime domain. Because of the inherent computational complexity of the multidimensional clustering, we introduce a coarse hierarchical clustering approach, which closely approximates the full hierarchy generation, and considerably improves the performance. The resulting clusters are visualized by representative patharrows, in combination with an illustrative anatomical context.

Although tools for tracing and presenting brain fibers are advanced, it is still difficult for physicians or students to explore the dataset in 3D due to their intricate topology. In this work we present a visual exploration approach for fiber tracts data aimed at supporting exploration of such data. The work employs a local, precise and fast 2D multidimensional projection technique that allows a large number of fibers to be handled simultaneously and to select groups of bundled fibers for further exploration. In this approach, a DTI feature dataset, including curvature as well as spatial features, is projected on a 2D or 3D view. By handling groups formed in this view, exploration is linked to corresponding brain fibers in object space. The link exists in both directions and fibers selected in object space are also mapped to feature space. Our approach also allows users to modify the projection, controlling and improving, if necessary, the definition of groups of fibers for small and large datasets, due to the local nature of the projection. Compared to other related work, the method presented here is faster for creating visual representations, making it possible to explore complete sets of fibers tracts up to 250K fibers, which was not possible previously. Additionally, the ability to change configuration of the feature space representation adds a high degree of flexibility to the process.",Jorge Poco;Danilo Medeiros Eler;Fernando Vieira Paulovich;Rosane Minghim,

Stream surfaces are one of many useful integration based techniques for visualizing 3D flow. However seeding integral surfaces can be challenging. Previous research generally focuses on manual placement of stream surfaces. Little attention has been given to the problem of automatic stream surface seeding. This paper introduces a novel automatic stream surface seeding strategy based on vector field clustering. It is important that the user can define and target particular characteristics of the flow. Our framework provides this ability. The user is able to specify different vector clustering parameters enabling a range of abstraction for the density and placement of seeding curves and their associated stream surfaces.

Our scheme contributes to three different applications: (a) high‐quality dye advection at low numerical diffusion, (b) physically‐based dye advection accounting for diffusivity of virtual media, and (c) visualization of advection‐diffusion fluxes in physical media where the velocity field is accompanied by a concentration field.

Such representation is highly desirable for exploratory analysis of document collections. In this paper we present a novel approach to build document clouds, named ProjCloud that aim at solving both semantical layouts and linking with document sets. ProjCloud generates a semantically consistent layout from a set of documents. Through a multidimensional projection, it is possible to visualize the neighborhood relationship between highly related documents and their corresponding word clouds simultaneously. Additionally, we propose a new algorithm for building word clouds inside polygons, which employs spectral sorting to maintain the semantic relationship among words.

EuroVis,2012,iVisClustering: An Interactive Visual Document Clustering via Topic Modeling,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03108.x,"AbstractClustering plays an important role in many large‐scale data analyses providing users with an overall understanding of their data. Nonetheless, clustering is not an easy task due to noisy features and outliers existing in the data, and thus the clustering results obtained from automatic algorithms often do not make clear sense. To remedy this problem, automatic clustering should be complemented with interactive visualization strategies. This paper proposes an interactive visual analytics system for document clustering, called iVisClustering, based on a widely‐used topic modeling method, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). iVisClustering provides a summary of each cluster in terms of its most representative keywords and visualizes soft clustering results in parallel coordinates. The main view of the system provides a 2D plot that visualizes cluster similarities and the relation among data items with a graph‐based representation. iVisClustering provides several other views, which contain useful interaction methods. With help of these visualization modules, we can interactively refine the clustering results in various ways. Keywords can be adjusted so that they characterize each cluster better. In addition, our system can filter out noisy data and re‐cluster the data accordingly. Cluster hierarchy can be constructed using a tree structure and for this purpose, the system supports cluster‐level interactions such as sub‐clustering, removing unimportant clusters, merging the clusters that have similar meanings, and moving certain clusters to any other node in the tree structure. Furthermore, the system provides document‐level interactions such as moving mis‐clustered documents to another cluster and removing useless documents.

Since there are no tools supporting this process, much of this work is done using ad‐hoc scripts and static plots, which is inefficient and limits visual exploration of the data. To address this, we have developed StratomeX, an integrative visualization tool that allows investigators to explore the relationships of candidate subtypes across multiple genomic data types such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or copy number data. StratomeX represents datasets as columns and subtypes as bricks in these columns. Ribbons between the columns connect bricks to show subtype relationships across datasets. Drill‐down features enable detailed exploration. StratomeX provides insights into the functional and clinical implications of candidate subtypes by employing small multiples, which allow investigators to assess the effect of subtypes on molecular pathways or outcomes such as patient survival. As the configuration of viewing parameters in such a multi‐dataset, multi‐view scenario is complex, we propose a meta visualization and configuration interface for dataset dependencies and data‐view relationships. StratomeX is developed in close collaboration with domain experts.

A visualization pipeline for the interactive exploration and visual analysis of CFRP specimens is developed to enhance the evaluation workflow for non‐destructive testing (NDT) practitioners based on specified tasks. Besides quantitative porosity determination and the calculation of local pore properties, i.e., volume, surface, dimensions and shape factors, we employ a drill‐down approach to explore pores in a CFRP specimen. We introduce Porosity Maps (PM), to allow for a fast porosity evaluation of the specimen. Pores are filtered in two stages. First a region of interest is selected in the porosity maps. Second, pores are filtered with parallel coordinates according to their local properties. Furthermore a histogram‐based best‐viewpoint widget was implemented to visualize the quality of viewpoints on a sphere. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated using real world CFRP specimens. We are able to show that our visualization‐driven approach leads to a better evaluation of CFRP components than existing reference methods.",Andreas Reh;B. Plank;Johann Kastner;M.

An analysis has many facets, including distributions of extracted features, comparisons between ensemble members and target functions, and details‐on‐demand. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of an interactive approach for a comparative visual analysis of 2D function ensembles. The design focuses on a tight integration of domain‐oriented and member‐oriented visualization techniques, and it seeks to preserve the mental model of 2D functions on multiple levels of detail. In this context, we propose a novel focus+context approach for visualizations relying on data‐driven placement which is based on labeling. We also extend work on feature‐preserving downsampling of 2D functions. Our design supports a comparison of 2D functions based on juxtaposition, overlay, and explicit differences. It also enables an analysis in terms of extracted scalar features and 1D aggregations. An evaluation illustrates a workflow in our application context.

Despite its intuitiveness, the effectiveness of animation in node‐link diagrams has been questioned, and several empirical studies have shown that animation is not necessarily superior to static visualizations. However, the exact mechanics of perceiving animated node‐link diagrams are still unclear. In this paper, we study the impact of different dynamic graph metrics on user perception of the animation. After deriving candidate visual graph metrics, we perform an exploratory user study where participants are asked to reconstruct the event sequence in animated node‐link diagrams. Based on these findings, we conduct a second user study where we investigate the most important visual metrics in depth. Our findings show that node speed and target separation are prominent visual metrics to predict the performance of event sequencing tasks.",Sohaib Ghani;Niklas Elmqvist;Ji Soo Yi,

Second, we design and implement a set of eight example visualizations suggested by the taxonomy and evaluate their utility in a quantitative user study. Third, together with biomechanics collaborators, we conduct a qualitative evaluation of the eight example visualizations applied to a current study of human spinal kinematics. Results suggest that visualizations in this style that use interactive control for the time dimension of the data are preferable to others.

Many companies use competitive intelligence to identify risks and opportunities within markets. Point of sale data that retailers share with vendors is of critical importance in developing competitive intelligence. However, existing tools do not easily enable the analysis of such large and complex data. therefore, new approaches are needed in order to facilitate better analysis and decision making. In this paper, we present MarketAnalyzer, an interactive visual analytics system designed to allow vendors to increase their competitive intelligence. MarketAnalyzer utilizes pixel‐based matrices to present sale data, trends, and market share growths of products of the entire market within a single display. These matrices are augmented by advanced underlying analytical methods to enable the quick evaluation of growth and risk within market sectors. Furthermore, our system enables the aggregation of point of sale data in geographical views that provide analysts with the ability to explore the impact of regional demographics and trends.

For example, in soccer and rugby, team analysts may annotate videos during the matches by tagging specific actions and events, which typically result in some summary statistics and a large spreadsheet of recorded actions and events. To a coach, the summary statistics (e.g., the percentage of ball possession) lacks sufficient details, while reading the spreadsheet is time‐consuming and making decisions based on the spreadsheet in real‐time is thereby impossible. In this paper, we present a visualization solution to the current problem in real‐time sports performance analysis. We adopt a glyph‐based visual design to enable coaching staff and analysts to visualize actions and events “at a glance”. We discuss the relative merits of metaphoric glyphs in comparison with other types of glyph designs in this particular application. We describe an algorithm for managing the glyph layout at different spatial scales in interactive visualization. We demonstrate the use of this technical approach through its application in rugby, for which we delivered the visualization software, MatchPad, on a tablet computer. The MatchPad was used by the Welsh Rugby Union during the Rugby World Cup 2011. It successfully helped coaching staff and team analysts to examine actions and events in detail whilst maintaining a clear overview of the match, and assisted in their decision making during the matches. It also allows coaches to convey crucial information back to the players in a visually‐engaging manner to help improve their performance.",Philip A. Legg;David H. S. Chung;Matthew L. Parry;Mark W.

These many techniques have different advantages, and users may wish to use several charts or data graphics to understand a dataset from different perspectives. We present ConnectedCharts, a technique for displaying relationships between multiple charts. ConnectedCharts allow for hybrid combinations of bar charts, scatterplots, and parallel coordinates, with curves drawn to show the conceptual links between charts. The charts can be thought of as coordinated views, where linking is achieved not only through interactive brushing, but also with explicitly drawn curves that connect corresponding data tuples or axes. We present a formal description of a design space of many simple charts, and also identify different kinds of connections that can be displayed between related charts. Our prototype implementation demonstrates how the connections between multiple charts can make relationships clearer and can serve to document the history of a user's analytical process, leading to potential applications in visual analytics and dashboard design.",Christophe Viau;Michael J.

The design of them mostly depends on the user's experience and thus remains a challenge. Therefore, we present an approach in this paper to automate the transfer function design based on 2D density plots. By exploiting their smoothness, we adopted the Morse theory to automatically decompose the feature space into a set of valley cells. We design a simplification process based on cell separability to eliminate cells which are mainly caused by noise in the original volume data. Boundary persistence is first introduced to measure the separability between adjacent cells and to suitably merge them. Afterward, a reasonable classification result is achieved where each cell represents a potential feature in the volume data. This classification procedure is automatic and facilitates an arbitrary number and shape of features in the feature space. The opacity of each feature is determined by its persistence and size. To further incorporate the user's prior knowledge, a hierarchical feature representation is created by successive merging of the cells. With this representation, the user is allowed to merge or split features of interest and set opacity and color freely. Experiments on various volumetric data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach in transfer function generation.",Yunhai Wang;Jian Zhang 0070;Dirk J.

Our method allows the user to intuitively modify the object classification and the importance distribution function in the 2D rendered image. It automatically computes the transfer function, especially the color distribution, to convey the importance of the objects. In our approach, the importance of an object is represented as the attentiveness of a color. In addition, we preserve the color harmony in the rendered image in order to provide a visually pleasing result. In this paper, we propose a set of computational measurements to compute the color attentiveness and color harmony. Our color assignment algorithm supports arbitrary‐dimensional transfer functions and obtains interactive frame rates. Our method involves three color spaces, namely Coloroid system, CIE LChuv, and Adobe RGB color space. It calculates the color attentiveness in CIE LChuv space, and the color harmony in Coloroid system. It, then, assigns the transfer function in a dual space of Adobe RGB space and renders the resulting image in Adobe RGB space. We conducted a detailed user study, which proves that our method successfully conveys the importance distributions.

In our approach, the volume is decomposed into a multiresolution hierarchy of bricks. Each brick is further subdivided into smaller blocks, which are compactly described by sparse linear combinations of prototype blocks stored in an overcomplete dictionary. The dictionary is learned, using limited computational and memory resources, by applying the K‐SVD algorithm to a re‐weighted non‐uniformly sampled subset of the input volume, harnessing the recently introduced method of coresets. The result is a scalable high quality coding scheme, which allows very large volumes to be compressed off‐line and then decompressed on‐demand during real‐time GPU‐accelerated rendering. Volumetric information can be maintained in compressed format through all the rendering pipeline. In order to efficiently support high quality filtering and shading, a specialized real‐time renderer closely coordinates decompression with rendering, combining at each frame images produced by raycasting selectively decompressed portions of the current view‐ and transfer‐function‐dependent working set.

Here, the problem arises to render millions to billions of atoms. We propose a method by which it is possible to interactively visualize atomic data, bridging five orders of magnitude in length scale. For this, we propose a simple yet efficient GPU rendering method that enables interactive visualization of biological structures consisting of up to several billions of atoms. To be able to load all atomic data onto the GPU, we exploit the fact that biological structures often consist of recurring molecular substructures. We also exploit that these objects typically are rendered opaquely, so that only a fraction of the atoms is visible. The method is demonstrated on both biological structures as well as atom probe tomography data of an inorganic specimen. We conclude with a discussion about when ‐during ascension from atomic to mesoscopic scale – level‐of‐detail representations become necessary.",Norbert Lindow;Daniel Baum;Hans-Christian Hege,

We initially intended to use these measures to provide guidance for the use of dimension reduction (DR) techniques and visual encoding (VE) choices, but found that they failed to produce reliable results. To understand why, we conducted a systematic qualitative data study covering a broad collection of 75 real and synthetic high‐dimensional datasets, four DR techniques, and three scatterplot‐based visual encodings. Two authors visually inspected over 800 plots to determine whether or not the measures created plausible results. We found that they failed in over half the cases overall, and in over two‐thirds of the cases involving real datasets. Using open and axial coding of failure reasons and separability characteristics, we generated a taxonomy of visual cluster separability factors. We iteratively refined its explanatory clarity and power by mapping the studied datasets and success and failure ranges of the measures onto the factor axes. Our taxonomy has four categories, ordered by their ability to influence successors: Scale, Point Distance, Shape, and Position. Each category is split into Within‐Cluster factors such as density, curvature, isotropy, and clumpiness, and Between‐Cluster factors that arise from the variance of these properties, culminating in the overarching factor of class separation. The resulting taxonomy can be used to guide the design and the evaluation of cluster separation measures.",Michael Sedlmair;A. Tatu;Tamara Munzner;Melanie Tory,
EuroVis,2012,Semi-Supervised Dimensionality Reduction based on Partial Least Squares for Visual Analysis of High Dimensional Data,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03126.x,"AbstractDimensionality reduction is employed for visual data analysis as a way to obtaining reduced spaces for high dimensional data or to mapping data directly into 2D or 3D spaces. Although techniques have evolved to improve data segregation on reduced or visual spaces, they have limited capabilities for adjusting the results according to user's knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to handling both dimensionality reduction and visualization of high dimensional data, taking into account user's input. It employs Partial Least Squares (PLS), a statistical tool to perform retrieval of latent spaces focusing on the discriminability of the data. The method employs a training set for building a highly precise model that can then be applied to a much larger data set very effectively. The reduced data set can be exhibited using various existing visualization techniques. The training data is important to code user's knowledge into the loop. However, this work also devises a strategy for calculating PLS reduced spaces when no training data is available. The approach produces increasingly precise visual mappings as the user feeds back his or her knowledge and is capable of working with small and unbalanced training sets.",Jose Gustavo Paiva;William Robson Schwartz;Hélio Pedrini;Rosane Minghim,

Unsurprisingly, many methods have been proposed to solve this task. However, the behavior of such methods during the exploration stage, when the user tries to understand the data with panning and zooming, has not been given much attention.In this paper, we propose a method that uses procedural texture synthesis to create zoom‐independent visualizations of three scalar data attributes. The method is based on random‐phase Gabor noise, whose frequency is adapted for the visualization of the first data attribute. We ensure that the resulting texture frequency lies in the range that is perceived well by the human visual system at any zoom level. To enhance the perception of this attribute, we also apply a specially constructed transfer function that is based on statistical properties of the noise. Additionally, the transfer function is constructed in a way that it does not introduce any aliasing to the texture. We map the second attribute to the texture orientation. The third attribute is color coded and combined with the texture by modifying the value component of the HSV color model. The necessary contrast needed for texture and color perception was determined in a user study. In addition, we conducted a second user study that shows significant advantages of our method over current methods with similar goals. We believe that our method is an important step towards creating methods that not only succeed in visualizing multiple data attributes, but also adapt to the behavior of the user during the data exploration stage.",Rostislav Khlebnikov;Bernhard Kainz;Markus Steinberger;Marc Streit;Dieter Schmalstieg,

We present an experimental comparison of user performance (time and error distance) across four multivariate data visualizations. Three variants of scatterplot (SCP) visualizations, namely SCPs with common vertical axes (SCP‐common), SCPs with a staircase layout (SCP‐staircase), and SCPs with rotated axes between neighboring cells (SCP‐rotated), and a baseline parallel coordinate plots (PCP) were compared. Results show that the baseline PCP is better than SCP‐rotated and SCP‐staircase under all conditions, while the difference between SCP‐common and PCP depends on the dimensionality and density of the dataset. PCP shows advantages over SCP‐common when the dimensionality and density of the dataset are low, but SCP‐common eventually outperforms PCP as data dimensionality and density increase. The results suggest guidelines for the use of SCPs and PCPs that can benefit future researchers and practitioners.",Xiaole Kuang;Haimo Zhang;Shengdong Zhao;Michael J. McGuffin,

With this technique the visual representation scales seamlessly from an exact line drawing, (for low‐frequency/low‐complexity curves) to a probability density estimate for more intricate situations.

We generate a 2×2 tensor field during line rasterization that encodes the distribution of line orientations through each image pixel. Anisotropic diffusion of a noise texture is then used to generate a dense, coherent visualization of line orientation. In order to represent features of different scales, we employ a multi‐resolution representation of the tensor field. The resulting technique can easily be applied to a wide variety of line‐based visualizations. We demonstrate this for parallel coordinates, a time‐series visualization, and a phase‐space diagram. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate a focus+context approach by incorporating a second tensor field.

This paper presents a scalable and progressive rendering algorithm for continuous data plots that allows exploratory analysis of large datasets at interactive framerates. The algorithm employs splatting to produce a series of plots that are combined using alpha blending to achieve a progressively improving image. For each individual frame, splats are obtained by transforming Gaussian density kernels from the 3‐D domain of the input dataset to the respective data domain. A closed‐form analytic description of the resulting splat footprints is derived to allow pre‐computation of splat textures for efficient GPU rendering. The plotting method is versatile because it supports arbitrary reconstruction or interpolation schemes for the input data and the splatting technique is scalable because it chooses splat samples independently from the size of the input dataset.

Our user‐driven approach enables expert users to select a certain cavity and track its evolution over time. The user is supported by different visualizations of the extracted cavity to facilitate the analysis. The boundary of the protein and its cavities is obtained by means of volume ray casting, where the volume is computed in real‐time for each frame, therefore allowing the examination of time‐dependent data sets. A fast, partial segmentation of the volume is applied to obtain the selected cavity and trace it over time. Domain experts found our method useful when they applied it exemplarily on two trajectories of lipases from Rhizomucor miehei and Candida antarctica.

Many methods for visualizing time series data exist, generally mapping the data values to positions or colors. While each can be used to perform a subset of the above tasks, none to date is a complete solution. In this paper we present a novel approach to time‐series data visualization, namely creating multivariate data records out of short subsequences of the data and then using multivariate visualization methods to display and explore the data in the resulting shape space. We borrow ideas from text analysis, where the use of N‐grams is a common approach to decomposing and processing unstructured text. By mapping each temporal N‐gram to a glyph, and then positioning the glyphs via PCA (basically a projection in shape space), many different kinds of patterns in the sequence can be readily identified. Interactive selection via brushing, in conjunction with linking to other visualizations, provides a wide range of tools for exploring the data. We validate the usefulness of this approach with examples from several application domains and tasks, comparing our methods with traditional time‐series visualizations.",Matthew O. Ward;Zhenyu Guo,
EuroVis,2011,Interactive Visual Analysis of Temporal Cluster Structures,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01920.x,"AbstractCluster analysis is a useful method which reveals underlying structures and relations of items after grouping them into clusters. In the case of temporal data, clusters are defined over time intervals where they usually exhibit structural changes. Conventional cluster analysis does not provide sufficient methods to analyze these structural changes, which are, however, crucial in the interpretation and evaluation of temporal clusters. In this paper, we present two novel and interactive visualization techniques that enable users to explore and interpret the structural changes of temporal clusters. We introduce the temporal cluster view, which visualizes the structural quality of a number of temporal clusters, and temporal signatures, which represents the structure of clusters over time. We discuss how these views are utilized to understand the temporal evolution of clusters.

In this paper, we discuss the design and development of tools to support this work. Based on analysis of the needs of literary scholars, we constructed a suite of visualization tools for the analysis of large collections of tagged text (i.e. text where one or more words have been annotated as belonging to a specific category). These tools unite the aspects of the scholars’ work: large scale overview tools help to identify corpus‐wide statistical patterns while fine scale analysis tools assist in finding specific details that support these observations. We designed visual tools that support and integrate these levels of analysis. The result is the first tool suite that can support the multilevel text analysis performed by scholars, combining standard visual elements with novel methods for selecting individual texts and identifying represenative passages in them.",Michael Correll;Michael Witmore;Michael Gleicher,

Although word clouds can help users understand the major content of a document collection quickly, their ability to visually compare documents is limited. This paper introduces a new method to create semantic‐preserving word clouds by leveraging tailored seam carving, a well‐established content‐aware image resizing operator. The method can optimize a word cloud layout by removing a left‐to‐right or top‐to‐bottom seam iteratively and gracefully from the layout. Each seam is a connected path of low energy regions determined by a Gaussian‐based energy function. With seam carving, we can pack the word cloud compactly and effectively, while preserving its overall semantic structure. Furthermore, we design a set of interactive visualization techniques for the created word clouds to facilitate visual text analysis and comparison. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our techniques.",Yingcai Wu;Thomas Provan;Furu Wei;Shixia Liu;Kwan-Liu Ma,

In this work, we extend PV feature extraction to higher‐order data represented by piecewise analytical functions defined over grid cells. The extraction uses PV in two distinct stages. First, seed points on the feature lines are placed by evaluating the inclusion form of the PV criterion with reduced affine arithmetic. Second, a feature flow field is derived from the higher‐order PV expression where the features can be extracted as streamlines starting at the seeds. Our approach allows for guaranteed bounds regarding accuracy with respect to existence, position, and topology of the features obtained. The method is suitable for parallel implementation and we present results obtained with our GPU‐based prototype.

Experience has shown that the resulting structures are often close to material structures (i.e., material lines or material surfaces). Moreover, it has been proven that for an integration time converging to infinity, they converge to exact material structures. However, due to the finite integration time in FTLE, they are generally not exact material structures.In this paper we introduce a modification of the FTLE method which is guaranteed to produce separating material structures as features of a scalar field. We achieve this by incorporating the complete available integration time both in forward and backward direction, and by choosing an appropriate definition for separating structures. We apply our method to two test data sets and show the differences to classical FTLE.",Tobias Germer;Mathias Otto;Ronald Peikert;Holger Theisel,

In this paper we present an approach that builds upon a decomposition of the flow field according to dynamical importance of different scales of motion energy. Focusing on the high‐energy scales leads to a reduction of the flow field while retaining the underlying physical process. The presented method acknowledges the intrinsic structures of the flow according to its energy and therefore allows to focus on the energetically most interesting aspects of the flow. Our analysis shows that this approach can be used for methods based on both local feature extraction and particle integration and we provide a discussion of the error caused by the approximation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed approach for both a local and a global feature detector and in the context of numerical flow simulations.",Armin Pobitzer;M.

We present a vision‐based reconstruction system for the three most commonly‐used visual representations of vector fields, namely streamlines, arrow glyphs, and line integral convolution.

In this user study, we test the performance of three of these visualizations with respect to three movement features that occur in vessel behavior. Our goal is to compare the recently presented vessel density by Willems et al. [WvdWvW09] with well‐known trajectory visualizations such as an animation of moving dots and the space‐time cube. We test these visualizations with common maritime analysis tasks by investigating the ability of users to find stopping objects, fast moving objects, and estimate the busiest routes in vessel trajectories. We test the robustness of the visualizations towards scalability and the influence of complex trajectories using small‐scale synthetic data sets. The performance is measured in terms of correctness and response time. The user test shows that each visualization type excels for correctness for a specific movement feature. Vessel density performs best for finding stopping objects, but does not perform significantly less than the remaining visualizations for the other features. Therefore, vessel density is a nice extension in the toolkit for analyzing trajectories of moving objects, in particular for vessel movements, since stops can be visualized better, and the performance for comparing lanes and finding fast movers is at a similar level as established trajectory visualizations.",Niels Willems;Huub van de Wetering;Jarke J. van Wijk,

Recently, deformation models have emerged as simple methods to capture the variability and statistical properties of a collection of images. Such models have proven to be effective in tasks such as image classification, generation, registration, segmentation, and analysis of modes of variation. A crucial element missing from most statistical models has been an effective way to summarize and visualize the statistical morphological properties of a group of images. This paper evaluates different visualization techniques that can be extended and used to illustrate the information captured by such statistical models. First, four illustration techniques are described as methods to summarize the statistical morphological properties as captured by deformation models. Second, results of a user study conducted to compare the effectiveness of each visualization technique are presented. After comparing the performance of 40 subjects, we found that statistical annotation techniques present significant benefits when analyzing the structural properties of a group of images.",Jesus J.

EuroVis,2011,Complete Tensor Field Topology on 2D Triangulated Manifolds embedded in 3D,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01932.x,"AbstractThis paper is concerned with the extraction of the surface topology of tensor fields on 2D triangulated manifolds embedded in 3D. In scientific visualization topology is a meaningful instrument to get a hold on the structure of a given dataset. Due to the discontinuity of tensor fields on a piecewise planar domain, standard topology extraction methods result in an incomplete topological skeleton. In particular with regard to the high computational costs of the extraction this is not satisfactory. This paper provides a method for topology extraction of tensor fields that leads to complete results. The core idea is to include the locations of discontinuity into the topological analysis. For this purpose the model of continuous transition bridges is introduced, which allows to capture the entire topology on the discontinuous field. The proposed method is applied to piecewise linear three‐dimensional tensor fields defined on the vertices of the triangulation and for piecewise constant two or three‐dimensional tensor fields given per triangle, e.g. rate of strain tensors of piecewise linear flow fields.",Cornelia Auer;Ingrid Hotz,

In this paper, we extend this framework towards higher‐order tensors. First, we establish formal uniqueness properties for a geometrically constrained tensor decomposition. This allows us to define and visualize topological structures in symmetric tensor fields of orders three and four. We clarify that in 2D, degeneracies occur at isolated points, regardless of tensor order. However, for orders higher than two, they are no longer equivalent to isotropic tensors, and their fractional Poincaré index prevents us from deriving continuous vector fields from the tensor decomposition. Instead, sorting the terms by magnitude leads to a new type of feature, lines along which the resulting vector fields are discontinuous. We propose algorithms to extract these features and present results on higher‐order derivatives and higher‐order structure tensors.",Thomas Schultz 0001,
EuroVis,2011,Stable Morse Decompositions for Piecewise Constant Vector Fields on Surfaces,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01934.x,"AbstractNumerical simulations and experimental observations are inherently imprecise. Therefore, most vector fields of interest in scientific visualization are known only up to an error. In such cases, some topological features, especially those not stable enough, may be artifacts of the imprecision of the input. This paper introduces a technique to compute topological features of user‐prescribed stability with respect to perturbation of the input vector field. In order to make our approach simple and efficient, we develop our algorithms for the case of piecewise constant (PC) vector fields. Our approach is based on a super‐transition graph, a common graph representation of all PC vector fields whose vector value in a mesh triangle is contained in a convex set of vectors associated with that triangle. The graph is used to compute a Morse decomposition that is coarse enough to be correct for all vector fields satisfying the constraint. Apart from computing stable Morse decompositions, our technique can also be used to estimate the stability of Morse sets with respect to perturbation of the vector field or to compute topological features of continuous vector fields using the PC framework.",Andrzej Szymczak,

EuroVis,2011,Visual Boosting in Pixel-based Visualizations,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01936.x,"AbstractPixel‐based visualizations have become popular, because they are capable of displaying large amounts of data and at the same time provide many details. However, pixel‐based visualizations are only effective if the data set is not sparse and the data distribution not random. Single pixels – no matter if they are in an empty area or in the middle of a large area of differently colored pixels – are perceptually difficult to discern and may therefore easily be missed. Furthermore, trends and interesting passages may be camouflaged in the sea of details. In this paper we compare different approaches for visual boosting in pixel‐based visualizations. Several boosting techniques such as halos, background coloring, distortion, and hatching are discussed and assessed with respect to their effectiveness in boosting single pixels, trends, and interesting passages. Application examples from three different domains (document analysis, genome analysis, and geospatial analysis) show the general applicability of the techniques and the derived guidelines.",Daniela Oelke;Halldor Janetzko;Svenja Simon;Klaus Neuhaus;Daniel A.

For example, by bending the space in the right way we can bring together details from two separate areas for easy comparison while roughly keeping the context that situates each area within the global space. While these techniques can be powerful tools, they also introduce distortions that need to be understood, and often the tools have to be disabled in order to have access to the undistorted data. We introduce the undistort lens, a complement to existing distortion‐based techniques that provides a local and separate presentation of the original geometry without affecting any distortion‐based lenses currently used in the presentation. The undistort lens is designed to allow interactive access to the underlying undistorted data within the context of the distorted space, and to enable a better understanding of the distortions. The paper describes the implementation of a generic back‐mapping mechanism that enables the implementation of undistort lenses for arbitrary distortion based techniques, including those presented in the lens literature.

Usually, for a given dataset, an optimal data description does not exist, as the suitable data representation is strongly use case dependent. Many solutions for selecting a suitable data description have been proposed. In most instances, they require data labels and often are black box approaches. Non‐expert users have difficulties to comprehend the coherency of input, parameters, and output of these algorithms. Alternative approaches, interactive systems for visual feature selection, overburden the user with an overwhelming set of options and data views. Therefore, it is essential to offer the users a guidance in this analytical process. In this paper, we present a novel system for data description selection, which facilitates the user's access to the data analysis process. As finding of suitable data description consists of several steps, we support the user with guidance. Our system combines automatic data analysis with interactive visualizations. By this, the system provides a recommendation for suitable data descriptor selections. It supports the comparison of data descriptors with differing dimensionality for unlabeled data. We propose specialized scores and interactive views for descriptor comparison. The visualization techniques are scatterplot‐based and grid‐based. For the latter case, we apply Self‐Organizing Maps as adaptive grids which are well suited for large multi‐dimensional data sets.

However, the analytical tasks, such as expression classification, have been hindered by the lack of understanding of the complex data space and the associated algorithm space. Conventional graph‐based time‐series visualization is also found inadequate to support such tasks. In this work, we adopt a visual analytics approach by visualizing the correlation between the algorithm space and our goal – classifying facial dynamics.

We employ methods from statistical learning to predict results in real‐time at any user‐defined point and its neighborhood. In particular, we describe techniques to guide the user to potentially interesting parameter regions, and we visualize the inherent uncertainty of predictions in 2D scatterplots and parallel coordinates.

While there has been significant development in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery, there is still the need for improved visualizations and generic solutions. The state‐of‐the‐art in visual analytics and exploratory data visualization is to incorporate more profound analysis methods while focusing on fast interactive abilities. The common trend in these scenarios is to either visualize an abstraction of the data set or to better utilize screen‐space.This paper presents a novel technique that combines clustering, dimension reduction and multi‐dimensional data representation to form a multivariate data visualization that incorporates both detail and overview. This amalgamation counters the individual drawbacks of common projection and multi‐dimensional data visualization techniques, namely ambiguity and clutter. A specific clustering criterion is used to decompose a multi‐dimensional data set into a hierarchical tree structure. This decomposition is embedded in a novel Dimensional Anchor visualization through the use of a weighted linear dimension reduction technique. The resulting Structural Decomposition Tree (SDT) provides not only an insight of the data set's inherent structure, but also conveys detailed coordinate value information.

This corresponds to computing the probabilities that the well‐known symmetry‐reduced marching cubes cases occur in random field realizations. For Gaussian random fields, only marginal density functions that correspond to the vertices of the considered cell need to be integrated. We compute the integrals for each cell in the sample grid using a Monte Carlo method.

We introduce an incremental update‐scheme that allows integrating the probability computation into front‐to‐back volume ray‐casting efficiently. Our method accounts for homogeneous and anisotropic correlations, and it determines for each sampling interval along a ray the probability of crossing an isosurface for the first time. To visualize the positional and geometrical uncertainty even under viewing directions parallel to the surface normal, we propose a new color mapping scheme based on the approximate spatial deviation of possible surface points from the mean surface. The additional use of saturation enables to distinguish between areas of high and low statistical dependence.

Many techniques for the exploration of spatio‐temporal data have been developed, but they prove to be only of limited use when applied to temporal origin‐destination datasets. We present Flowstrates, a new interactive visualization approach in which the origins and the destinations of the flows are displayed in two separate maps, and the changes over time of the flow magnitudes are represented in a separate heatmap view in the middle. This allows the users to perform spatial visual queries, focusing on different regions of interest for the origins and destinations, and to analyze the changes over time provided with the means of flow ordering, filtering and aggregation in the heatmap.

In this paper, we report the user‐centered design process carried out by the team, and present several visual encoding schemes that have met the requirements including compactness, intuitiveness, and ability to depict temporal changes and spatial relations. In particular, we designed a family of radial visualization, where radial lines correspond to different coastal locations, and nested rings represent the evolution of the temporal dimension from inner to outer circles. We developed an algorithm for mapping glacier terminus positions from Cartesian coordinates to angular coordinates.

Of particular scientific interest are coherent vortical features called mesoscale eddies. We first extract high‐vorticity features using a metric from the oceanography community called the Okubo‐Weiss parameter. We then use a new circularity criterion to differentiate eddies from other non‐eddy features like meanders in strong background currents. From these data, we generate visualizations showing the three‐dimensional structure and distribution of ocean eddies. Additionally, the characteristics of each eddy are recorded to form an eddy census that can be used to investigate correlations among variables such as eddy thickness, depth, and location. From these analyses, we gain insight into the role eddies play in large‐scale ocean circulation.",Sean Williams;Matthew Hecht;Mark R. Petersen;Richard Strelitz;Mathew Maltrud;James P.

However, computational models generate so much information regarding protein behavior that large‐scale analysis by traditional methods is almost impossible. The volume of data produced makes the transition from data to knowledge difficult and hinders biomedical advances.

EuroVis,2011,Visualising Errors in Animal Pedigree Genotype Data,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01950.x,"AbstractGenetic analysis of a breeding animal population involves determining the inheritance pattern of genotypes for multiple genetic markers across the individuals in the population pedigree structure. However, experimental pedigree genotype data invariably contains errors in both the pedigree structure and in the associated individual genotypes, introducing inconsistencies into the dataset, rendering them useless for further analysis. The resolution of these errors requires consideration of genotype inheritance patterns in the context of the pedigree structure. Existing pedigree visualisations are typically more suited to human pedigrees and are less suitable for large complex animal pedigrees which may exhibit cross generational inbreeding. Similarly, table‐based viewers of genotype marker data can highlight where errors become apparent but lack the functionality and interactive visual feedback to allow users to locate the origin of errors within the pedigree. In this paper, we detail a design study steered by biologists who work with pedigree data, and describe successive iterations through approaches and prototypes for viewing genotyping errors in the context of a displayed pedigree. We describe how each approach performs with real pedigree genotype data and why eventually we deemed them unsuitable. Finally, a novel prototype visualisation for pedigrees, which we term the ‘sandwich view’, is detailed and we demonstrate how the approach effectively communicates errors in the pedigree context, supporting the biologist in the error identification task.",Martin Graham 0001;Jessie B.

EuroVis,2011,Pathway Preserving Representation of Metabolic Networks,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01951.x,"AbstractImprovements in biological data acquisition and genomes sequencing now allow to reconstruct entire metabolic networks of many living organisms. The size and complexity of these networks prohibit manual drawing and thereby urge the need of dedicated visualization techniques. An efficient representation of such a network should preserve the topological information of metabolic pathways while respecting biological drawing conventions. These constraints complicate the automatic generation of such visualization as it raises graph drawing issues. In this paper we propose a method to lay out the entire metabolic network while preserving the pathway information as much as possible. That method is flexible as it enables the user to define whether or not node duplication should be performed, to preserve or not the network topology. Our technique combines partitioning, node placement and edge bundling to provide a pseudo‐orthogonal visualization of the metabolic network. To ease pathway information retrieval, we also provide complementary interaction tools that emphasize relevant pathways in the entire metabolic context.",Antoine Lambert;Jonathan Dubois;Romain Bourqui,

Therefore, we propose a dynamic shader pipeline based on the SuperShader concept and illustrate the design decisions. Also, important requirements for the development of our system are presented. In our approach, we break down the rendering shader into areas containing code for different computations, which are defined as freely combinable, modularized shader blocks. Hence, high‐level changes of the rendering configuration result in the implicit modification of the underlying shader pipeline. Furthermore, the prototyping system allows inserting custom shader code between shader blocks of the pipeline at run‐time. A suitable user interface is available within the prototyping environment to allow intuitive modification of the shader pipeline. Thus, appropriate solutions for visualization problems can be interactively developed. We demonstrate the usage and the usefulness of our framework with implementations of dynamic rendering effects for medical applications.",Christian Rieder;Stephan Palmer;Florian Link;Horst K. Hahn,

A better understanding of the inflow characteristics, the flow inside the aneurysm and the overall change of pre‐ and post‐aneurysm flow in the parent vessel provide insights for medical research and the development of new risk‐reduced treatment options. We present an approach for a qualitative, visual flow exploration that incorporates the ostium and derived anatomical landmarks. It is divided into three scopes: a global scope for exploration of the in‐ and outflow, an ostium scope that provides characteristics of the flow profile close to the ostium and a local scope for a detailed exploration of the flow in the parent vessel and the aneurysm. The approach was applied to five representative datasets, including measured and simulated blood flow.

This score volume is integrated into a volume rendering framework which allows the user to view the prostate gland, the multi‐modal score values, and the surrounding anatomy. A visibility persistence mode is introduced to automatically avoid full occlusion of a selected score and indicate overlaps. The use of GPU‐accelerated multi‐modal single‐pass ray casting provides an interactive experience.

EuroVis,2011,Visualizing the Evolution of Community Structures in Dynamic Social Networks,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01955.x,"AbstractSocial network analysis is the study of patterns of interaction between social entities. The field is attracting increasing attention from diverse disciplines including sociology, epidemiology, and behavioral ecology. An important sociological phenomenon that draws the attention of analysts is the emergence of communities, which tend to form, evolve, and dissolve gradually over a period of time. Understanding this evolution is crucial to sociologists and domain scientists, and often leads to a better appreciation of the social system under study. Therefore, it is imperative that social network visualization tools support this task. While graph‐based representations are well suited for investigating structural properties of networks at a single point in time, they appear to be significantly less useful when used to analyze gradual structural changes over a period of time. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization methodology for dynamic social networks. Our technique focuses on revealing the community structure implied by the evolving interaction patterns between individuals. We apply our visualization to analyze the community structure in the US House of Representatives. We also report on a user study conducted with the participation of behavioral ecologists working with social network datasets that depict interactions between wild animals.

The algorithm has a number of applications including: improving the layouts of planar graph drawing algorithms, interacting with a graph layout, and drawing Euler‐like diagrams. The algorithm ensures that nodes do not cross edges during its execution. However, PrEd can be computationally expensive and overly‐restrictive in terms of node movement.In this paper, we introduce ImPrEd: an improved version of PrEd that overcomes some of its limitations and widens its range of applicability. ImPrEd also adds features such as flexible or crossable edges, allowing for greater control over the output. Flexible edges, in particular, can improve the distribution of graph elements and the angular resolution of the input graph. They can also be used to generate Euler diagrams with smooth boundaries. As flexible edges increase data set size, we experience an execution/drawing quality trade off. However, when flexible edges are not used, ImPrEdproves to be consistently faster than PrEd.",Paolo Simonetto;Daniel Archambault;David Auber;Romain Bourqui,

However, high precision projection methods are either computationally expensive or not flexible enough to enable feedback from user interaction into the projection process. A built‐in mechanism that dynamically adapts the projection based on direct user intervention would make the technique more useful for a larger range of applications and data sets. In this paper we propose the Piecewise Laplacian‐based Projection (PLP), a novel multidimensional projection technique, that, due to the local nature of its formulation, enables a versatile mechanism to interact with projected data and to allow interactive changes to alter the projection map dynamically, a capability unique of this technique. We exploit the flexibility provided by PLP in two interactive projection‐based applications, one designed to organize pictures visually and another to build music playlists. These applications illustrate the usefulness of PLP in handling high‐dimensional data in a flexible and highly visual way.

EuroVis,2011,A Framework for Exploring Multidimensional Data with 3D Projections,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01960.x,"AbstractVisualization of high‐dimensional data requires a mapping to a visual space. Whenever the goal is to preserve similarity relations a frequent strategy is to use 2D projections, which afford intuitive interactive exploration, e.g., by users locating and selecting groups and gradually drilling down to individual objects. In this paper, we propose a framework for projecting high‐dimensional data to 3D visual spaces, based on a generalization of the Least‐Square Projection (LSP). We compare projections to 2D and 3D visual spaces both quantitatively and through a user study considering certain exploration tasks. The quantitative analysis confirms that 3D projections outperform 2D projections in terms of precision. The user study indicates that certain tasks can be more reliably and confidently answered with 3D projections. Nonetheless, as 3D projections are displayed on 2D screens, interaction is more difficult. Therefore, we incorporate suitable interaction functionalities into a framework that supports 3D transformations, predefined optimal 2D views, coordinated 2D and 3D views, and hierarchical 3D cluster definition and exploration. For visually encoding data clusters in a 3D setup, we employ color coding of projected data points as well as four types of surface renderings. A second user study evaluates the suitability of these visual encodings. Several examples illustrate the framework's applicability for both visual exploration of multidimensional abstract (non‐spatial) data as well as the feature space of multi‐variate spatial data.",Jorge Poco;Ronak Etemadpour;Fernando Vieira Paulovich;Tran Van Long;Paul Rosenthal;Maria Cristina Ferreira de Oliveira;Lars Linsen;Rosane Minghim,
EuroVis,2011,Visualizing High-Dimensional Structures by Dimension Ordering and Filtering using Subspace Analysis,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01961.x,"AbstractHigh‐dimensional data visualization is receiving increasing interest because of the growing abundance of high‐dimensional datasets. To understand such datasets, visualization of the structures present in the data, such as clusters, can be an invaluable tool. Structures may be present in the full high‐dimensional space, as well as in its subspaces. Two widely used methods to visualize high‐dimensional data are the scatter plot matrix (SPM) and the parallel coordinate plot (PCP). SPM allows a quick overview of the structures present in pairwise combinations of dimensions. On the other hand, PCP has the potential to visualize not only bi‐dimensional structures but also higher dimensional ones. A problem with SPM is that it suffers from crowding and clutter which makes interpretation hard. Approaches to reduce clutter are available in the literature, based on changing the order of the dimensions. However, usually this reordering has a high computational complexity. For effective visualization of high‐dimensional structures, also PCP requires a proper ordering of the dimensions.In this paper, we propose methods for reordering dimensions in PCP in such a way that high‐dimensional structures (if present) become easier to perceive. We also present a method for dimension reordering in SPM which yields results that are comparable to those of existing approaches, but at a much lower computational cost. Our approach is based on finding relevant subspaces for clustering using a quality criterion and cluster information. The quality computation and cluster detection are done in image space, using connected morphological operators. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for synthetic and astronomical datasets, and show that our method compares favorably with a number of existing approaches.",Bilkis J. Ferdosi;Jos B. T. M.

Simulation data generation rates will continue to be far greater than storage bandwidth rates by many orders of magnitude. This implies that only a very small fraction of data generated by a simulation can ever be stored and subsequently post‐analyzed. The limiting factors in this situation are similar to the problem in many population surveys: there aren't enough human resources to query a large population. To cope with the lack of resources, statistical sampling techniques are used to create a representative data set of a large population. Following this analogy, we propose to store a simulation‐time random sampling of the particle data for post‐analysis, with level‐of‐detail organization, to cope with the bottlenecks. A sample is stored directly from the simulation in a level‐of‐detail format for post‐visualization and analysis, which amortizes the cost of post‐processing and reduces workflow time. Additionally by sampling during the simulation, we are able to analyze the entire particle population to record full population statistics and quantify sample error.",Jonathan Woodring;James P.

Using the prior knowledge of the display surface being a dome, we can estimate the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and the projector to display surface correspondences automatically using a set of images. These images include the image of the dome itself and a projected pattern from each projector. Using these correspondences we can register images from the multiple projectors on the dome. Further, we can register displays which are not entirely visible in a single camera view using multiple pan and tilted views of an uncalibrated camera making our method suitable for displays of different size and resolution. We can register images from any arbitrary viewpoint making it appropriate for a single head‐tracked user in a 3D visualization system. Also, we can use several cartographic mapping techniques to register images in a manner that is appropriate for multi‐user visualization.Domes are known to produce a tremendous sense of immersion and presence in visualization systems. Yet, till date, there exists no easy way to register multiple projectors on a dome to create a high‐resolution realistic visualizations.

Iso‐surface similarity maps present structural information of a volume data set by depicting similarities between individual isosurfaces quantified by a robust information‐theoretic measure. Unlike conventional histograms, they are not based on the frequency of isovalues and/or derivatives and therefore provide complementary information. We demonstrate that this new representation can be used to guide transfer function design and visualization parameter specification.

Using real‐world data sets, we show that isosurface similarity maps can be a useful addition to conventional classification techniques.",Stefan Bruckner;Torsten Möller,
EuroVis,2010,An Exploratory Technique for Coherent Visualization of Time-varying Volume Data,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01690.x,"AbstractThe selection of an appropriate global transfer function is essential for visualizing time‐varying simulation data. This is especially challenging when the global data range is not known in advance, as is often the case in remote and in‐situ visualization settings. Since the data range may vary dramatically as the simulation progresses, volume rendering using local transfer functions may not be coherent for all time steps. We present an exploratory technique that enables coherent classification of time‐varying volume data. Unlike previous approaches, which require pre‐processing of all time steps, our approach lets the user explore the transfer function space without accessing the original 3D data. This is useful for interactive visualization, and absolutely essential for in‐situ visualization, where the entire simulation data range is not known in advance. Our approach generates a compact representation of each time step at rendering time in the form of ray attenuation functions, which are used for subsequent operations on the opacity and color mappings.

EuroVis,2010,Evaluation of Cluster Identification Performance for Different PCP Variants,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01666.x,"AbstractParallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a well‐known visualization technique for viewing multivariate data. In the past, various visual modifications to PCPs have been proposed to facilitate tasks such as correlation and cluster identification, to reduce visual clutter, and to increase their information throughput. Most modifications pertain to the use of color and opacity, smooth curves, or the use of animation. Although many of these seem valid improvements, only few user studies have been performed to investigate this, especially with respect to cluster identification. We performed a user study to evaluate cluster identification performance – with respect to response time and correctness – of nine PCP variations, including standard PCPs. To generate the variations, we focused on covering existing techniques as well as possible while keeping testing feasible. This was done by adapting and merging techniques, which led to the following novel variations. The first is an effective way of embedding scatter plots into PCPs. The second is a technique for highlighting fuzzy clusters based on neighborhood density. The third is a spline‐based drawing technique to reduce ambiguity. The last is a pair of animation schemes for PCP rotation. We present an overview of the tested PCP variations and the results of our study.

We call such areas Semantic Zones, and argue that support for their manipulation and reasoning with them is highly useful during exploratory analysis. An important use case is the use of these zones across different subsets of the data, for instance to study the population of semantic zones over time. To support this, we present the Select &amp; Slice Table. Semantic zones are arranged along one axis of the table, and data subsets are arranged along the other axis of the table. Each cell contains a set of items of interest from a data subset that matches the selection specifications of a zone. Items in cells can be visualized in various ways, as a count, as an aggregation of a measure, or as a separate visualization, such that the table gives an overview of the relationship between zones and data subsets. Furthermore, users can reuse zones, combine zones, and compare and trace items of interest across different semantic zones and data subsets.

Brushing particular statistics, the analyst can investigate data characteristics such as trends and outliers. We present a categorization of beneficial combinations of attributes in 2D scatterplots: (a) kth vs. (k + 1)th statistical moment of a traditional or robust estimate, (b) traditional vs. robust version of the same moment, (c) two different robust estimates of the same moment. We propose selected view transformations to iteratively construct this multitude of informative views as well as to enhance the depiction of the statistical properties in scatterplots and quantile plots.

Next, we render clusters at a user‐selected level of detail using a new image‐based technique that combines distance‐based splatting and shape skeletonization. The overall result displays a given graph as a small set of overlapping shaded edge bundles. Luminance, saturation, hue, and shading encode edge density, edge types, and edge similarity.

Edge bundling techniques have been proposed to help solve this issue, which rely on high quality edge rerouting. In this paper, we introduce an intuitive edge bundling technique which efficiently reduces edge clutter in graphs drawings. Our method is based on the use of a grid built using the original graph to compute the edge rerouting.

EuroVis,2010,Out-of-Core Simplification and Crack-Free LOD Volume Rendering for Irregular Grids,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01705.x,"AbstractWe propose a novel out‐of‐core simplification and level‐of‐detail (LOD) volume rendering algorithm for large irregular grids represented as tetrahedral meshes. One important feature of our algorithm is that it creates a space decomposition as required by I/O‐efficient simplification and volume rendering, and simplifies both the internal and boundary portions of the sub‐volumes progressively by edge collapses using the (extended) quadric error metric, while ensuring any selected LOD mesh to be crack‐free (i.e., any neighboring sub‐volumes in the LOD have consistent boundaries, and all the cells in the LOD do not have negative volumes), with all computations performed I/O‐ejficiently. This has been an elusive goal for out‐of‐core progressive meshes and LOD visualization, and our novel solution achieves this goal with a theoretical guarantee to be crack‐free for tetrahedral meshes. As for selecting a desirable LOD mesh for volume rendering, our technique supports selective refinement LODs (where different places can have different error bounds), in addition to the basic uniform LODs (where the error bound is the same in all places). The proposed scalar‐value range and view‐dependent selection queries for selective refinement are especially effective in producing images of the highest quality with a much faster rendering speed. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our new technique.",Zhiyan Du;Yi-Jen Chiang,

Our method extends the recent directional occlusion shading model by enabling light source positioning with practically no performance penalty. Light transport is approximated using a tilted cone‐shaped function which leaves elliptic footprints in the opacity buffer during slice‐based volume rendering. We perform an incremental blurring operation on the opacity buffer for each slice in front‐to‐back order. This buffer is then used to define the degree of occlusion for the subsequent slice. Our method is capable of generating high‐quality soft shadowing effects, allows interactive modification of all illumination and rendering parameters, and requires no pre‐computation.",Veronika Soltészová;Daniel Patel;Stefan Bruckner;Ivan Viola,

To estimate actual error behavior we conduct a thorough study using a volume renderer implemented with arbitrary floating‐point precision. Based on the experimental data we then model the impact of floating‐point pipeline precision, sampling frequency and fixed‐point input data quantization on the fidelity of rendered images. We introduce three models, an average model, which does not adapt to different data nor varying transfer functions, as well as two adaptive models that take the intricacies of a new data set and transfer function into account by adapting themselves given a few different images rendered. We also test and validate our models based on new data that was not used during our model building.",Joel Kronander;Jonas Unger;Torsten Möller;Anders Ynnerman,

Unlike recent similar approaches, our method is exclusively based on the rasterization of simple geometric primitives and takes full advantage of graphics hardware. Both vertex and geometry shaders are used to compute the tetrahedral projection, while the volume ray integral is evaluated in a fragment shader; hence, volume rendering is performed entirely on the GPU within a single pass through the pipeline. We apply a CUDA‐based visibility ordering achieving rendering and sorting performance of over 6 M Tet/s for unstructured datasets. Furthermore, as each tetrahedron is processed independently, we employ a data‐parallel solution which is neither bound by GPU memory size nor does it rely on auxiliary volume information. In addition, iso‐surfaces can be readily extracted during the rendering process, and time‐varying data are handled without extra burden.",André Maximo;Ricardo Marroquim;Ricardo C. Farias,
EuroVis,2010,Space-in-Time and Time-in-Space Self-Organizing Maps for Exploring Spatiotemporal Patterns,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01664.x,"AbstractSpatiotemporal data pose serious challenges to analysts in geographic and other domains. Owing to the complexity of the geospatial and temporal components, this kind of data cannot be analyzed by fully automatic methods but require the involvement of the human analyst's expertise. For a comprehensive analysis, the data need to be considered from two complementary perspectives: (1) as spatial distributions (situations) changing over time and (2) as profiles of local temporal variation distributed over space. In order to support the visual analysis of spatiotemporal data, we suggest a framework based on the “Self‐Organizing Map” (SOM) method combined with a set of interactive visual tools supporting both analytic perspectives. SOM can be considered as a combination of clustering and dimensionality reduction. In the first perspective, SOM is applied to the spatial situations at different time moments or intervals. In the other perspective, SOM is applied to the local temporal evolution profiles. The integrated visual analytics environment includes interactive coordinated displays enabling various transformations of spatiotemporal data and post‐processing of SOM results. The SOM matrix display offers an overview of the groupings of data objects and their two‐dimensional arrangement by similarity. This view is linked to a cartographic map display, a time series graph, and a periodic pattern view. The linkage of these views supports the analysis of SOM results in both the spatial and temporal contexts. The variable SOM grid coloring serves as an instrument for linking the SOM with the corresponding items in the other displays. The framework has been validated on a large dataset with real city traffic data, where expected spatiotemporal patterns have been successfully uncovered. We also describe the use of the framework for discovery of previously unknown patterns in 41‐years time series of 7 crime rate attributes in the states of the USA.",Gennady L. Andrienko;Natalia V.

The user may delineate regions with unseen differences that can affect the fairness of the comparisons made between them. To alleviate this problem, our interface first alerts the user if it detects any potential unfairness between regions when they are selected for comparison. It then presents the dimensions with potential problematic outliers to the user for evaluation. Finally, it provides a number of semi‐automated tools to assist the user in correcting their regions' boundaries to minimize the inequalities they feel could significantly impact their comparisons.",Thomas Butkiewicz;Ross K.

Visualizing the dynamic behavior of molecules is particularly interesting to gain insights into a molecular system. Only recently it has become possible to interactively visualize dynamic molecular surfaces using ray casting techniques.In this paper, we show how to further accelerate the construction and the rendering of the solvent excluded surface (SES) and the molecular skin surface (MSS). We propose several improvements to reduce the update times for displaying these molecular surfaces. First, we adopt a parallel approximate Voronoi diagram algorithm to compute the MSS. This accelerates the MSS computation by more than one order of magnitude on a single core. Second, we demonstrate that the contour‐buildup algorithm is ideally suited for computing the SES due to its inherently parallel structure. For both parallel algorithms, we observe good scalability up to 8 cores and, thus, obtain interactive frame rates for molecular dynamics trajectories of up to twenty thousand atoms for the SES and up to a few thousand atoms for the MSS. Third, we reduce the rendering time for the SES using tight‐fitting bounding quadrangles as rasterization primitives. These primitives also accelerate the rendering of the MSS. With these improvements, the interactive visualization of the MSS of dynamic trajectories of a few thousand atoms becomes for the first time possible. Nevertheless, the SES remains a few times faster than the MSS.",Norbert Lindow;Daniel Baum;Steffen Prohaska;Hans-Christian Hege,
EuroVis,2010,Coherent Culling and Shading for Large Molecular Dynamics Visualization,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01698.x,"AbstractMolecular dynamics simulations are a principal tool for studying molecular systems. Such simulations are used to investigate molecular structure, dynamics, and thermodynamical properties, as well as a replacement for, or complement to, costly and dangerous experiments. With the increasing availability of computational power the resulting data sets are becoming increasingly larger, and benchmarks indicate that the interactive visualization on desktop computers poses a challenge when rendering substantially more than millions of glyphs. Trading visual quality for rendering performance is a common approach when interactivity has to be guaranteed. In this paper we address both problems and present a method for high‐quality visualization of massive molecular dynamics data sets. We employ several optimization strategies on different levels of granularity, such as data quantization, data caching in video memory, and a two‐level occlusion culling strategy: coarse culling via hardware occlusion queries and a vertex‐level culling using maximum depth mipmaps. To ensure optimal image quality we employ GPU raycasting and deferred shading with smooth normal vector generation. We demonstrate that our method allows us to interactively render data sets containing tens of millions of high‐quality glyphs.",Sebastian Grottel;Guido Reina;Carsten Dachsbacher;Thomas Ertl,

While pointerless approaches exploit the regular structure of the tree to facilitate efficient data access, their memory footprint becomes prohibitively large as the height of the tree increases. Pointerbased trees require memory consumption proportional to the number of tree nodes, thus exploiting the typical sparsity of large trees. Yet, their traversal is slowed by the need to follow explicit pointers across the different levels. Our solution is a pointerless approach that represents each tree level with its own matrix, as opposed to traditional pointerless trees that use only a single vector. This novel data organization allows us to fully exploit the tree's regular structure and improve the performance of tree operations. By using a sparse matrix data structure we obtain a representation that is suited for sparse and dense trees alike. In particular, it uses less total memory than pointer‐based trees even when the data set is extremely sparse. We show how our approach is easily implemented on the GPU and illustrate its performance in typical visualization scenarios.",Nathan Andrysco;Xavier Tricoche,

A statistical shape model models the distribution in a high dimensional shape space, where each shape is represented by a single point.We present a design study on the intuitive exploration and visualization of shape spaces and shape models. Our approach focuses on the dual‐space nature of these spaces. The high‐dimensional shape space represents the population, whereas object space represents the shape of the 3D object associated with a point in shape space.A 3D object view provides local details for a single shape. The high dimensional points in shape space are visualized using a 2D scatter plot projection, the axes of which can be manipulated interactively. This results in a dynamic scatter plot, with the further extension that each point is visualized as a small version of the object shape that it represents. We further enhance the population‐object duality with a new type of view aimed at shape comparison. This new “shape evolution view” visualizes shape variability along a single trajectory in shape space, and serves as a link between the two spaces described above.Our three‐view exploration concept strongly emphasizes linked interaction between all spaces. Moving the cursor over the scatter plot or evolution views, shapes are dynamically interpolated and shown in the object view. Conversely, camera manipulation in the object view affects the object visualizations in the other views. We present a GPU‐accelerated implementation, and show the effectiveness of the three‐view approach using a number of real‐world cases.

While the validation of a model is a key part of its identification process, existing computation‐ or visualization‐based techniques do not adequately support all aspects of model validation. The main contribution of this paper is an interactive approach called HyperMoVal that is designed to support multiple tasks related to model validation: 1) comparing known and predicted results, 2) analyzing regions with a bad fit, 3) assessing the physical plausibility of models also outside regions covered by validation data, and 4) comparing multiple models. The key idea is to visually relate one or more n‐dimensional scalar functions to known validation data within a combined visualization. HyperMoVal lays out multiple 2D and 3D sub‐projections of the n‐dimensional function space around a focal point. We describe how linking HyperMoVal to other views further extends the possibilities for model validation. Based on this integration, we discuss steps towards supporting the entire workflow of identifying regression models. An evaluation illustrates a typical workflow in the application context of car‐engine design and reports general feedback of domain experts and users of our approach.

In the last decades, several fiber‐tracking methods have been developed to reconstruct the fiber tracts from DTI data. Usually these fiber tracts are shown individually based on some selection criteria like region of interest. However, if the white matter as a whole is being visualized clutter is generated by directly rendering the individual fiber tracts. Often users are actually interested in fiber bundles, anatomically meaningful entities that abstract from the fibers they contain. Several clustering techniques have been developed that try to group the fiber tracts in fiber bundles. However, even if clustering succeeds, the complex nature of white matter still makes it difficult to investigate. In this paper, we propose the use of illustration techniques to ease the exploration of white matter clusters. We create a technique to visualize an individual cluster as a whole. The amount of fibers visualized for the cluster is reduced to just a few hint lines, and silhouette and contours are used to improve the definition of the cluster borders. Multiple clusters can be easily visualized by a combination of the single cluster visualizations. Focus+context concepts are used to extend the multiple‐cluster renderings. Exploded views ease the exploration of the focus cluster while keeping the context clusters in an abstract form.

This technique allows us to produce a consistent and frame‐coherent appearance with precise control over the lines. In addition, we provide context through cutting planes onto which we render gray matter with stippling.

However, this requires the camera view to contain the entire display surface. This is often an impossible scenario for large displays, especially common in visualization, edutainment, training and simulation applications. In this paper we present a new method that can achieve an accurate geometric registration even when the field‐of‐view of the uncalibrated camera can cover only a part of the vertically extruded display at a time. We pan and tilt the camera from a single point and employ a multi‐view approach to register the projectors on the display. This allows the method to scale easily both in terms of camera resolution and display size. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve a scalable multi‐view geometric registration of large vertically extruded displays with a single uncalibrated camera.

The challenge inherent in the data is that the upper extremity is comprised of five cooperating joints with a total of fifteen degrees of freedom. The range of motion may be affected by subtle deficiencies of individual joints that are difficult to pinpoint. To highlight these subtleties our approach combines interactive filtering and multiple visualisation techniques.Our system is further differentiated by the fact that it integrates simultaneous acquisition and visual analysis of biokinematic data. Also, to facilitate complex queries, we have designed a visual query interface with visualisation and interaction elements that are based on the domain‐specific anatomical representation of the data. The combination of these techniques form an effective approach specifically tailored for the investigation and comparison of large collections of kinematic data.

Application to data from High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) shows that the method allows for interactive data exploration and confirms that the HOME glyph conveys fiber spread and crossings more effectively than the conventional polar plot.",Thomas Schultz 0001;Gordon L.

EuroVis,2010,Topology Aware Stream Surfaces,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01672.x,"AbstractWe present an algorithm that allows stream surfaces to recognize and adapt to vector field topology. Standard stream surface algorithms either refine the surface uncontrolled near critical points which slows down the computation considerably and may lead to a poor surface approximation. Alternatively, the concerned region is omitted from the stream surface by severing it into two parts thus generating an incomplete stream surface. Our algorithm utilizes topological information to provide a fast, accurate, and complete triangulation of the stream surface near critical points. The required topological information is calculated in a preprocessing step. We compare our algorithm against the standard approach both visually and in performance.",Dominic Schneider;Wieland Reich;Alexander Wiebel;Gerik Scheuermann,
EuroVis,2010,Toward a Lagrangian Vector Field Topology,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01686.x,AbstractIn this paper we present an extended critical point concept which allows us to apply vector field topology in the case of unsteady flow. We propose a measure for unsteadiness which describes the rate of change of the velocities in a fluid element over time. This measure allows us to select particles for which topological properties remain intact inside a finite spatio‐temporal neighborhood. One benefit of this approach is that the classification of critical points based on the eigenvalues of the Jacobian remains meaningful. In the steady case the proposed criterion reduces to the classical definition of critical points. As a first step we show that finding an optimal Galilean frame of reference can be obtained implicitly by analyzing the acceleration field. In a second step we show that this can be extended by switching to the Lagrangian frame of reference. This way the criterion can detect critical points moving along intricate trajectories. We analyze the behavior of the proposed criterion based on two analytical vector fields for which a correct solution is defined by their inherent symmetries and present results for numerical vector fields.,Raphael Fuchs;Jan Kemmler;Benjamin Schindler;Jürgen Waser;Filip Sadlo;Helwig Hauser;Ronald Peikert,
EuroVis,2010,The Readability of Path-Preserving Clusterings of Graphs,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01683.x,"AbstractGraph visualization systems often exploit opaque metanodes to reduce visual clutter and improve the readability of large graphs. This filtering can be done in a path‐preserving way based on attribute values associated with the nodes of the graph. Despite extensive use of these representations, as far as we know, no formal experimentation exists to evaluate if they improve the readability of graphs.In this paper, we present the results of a user study that formally evaluates how such representations affect the readability of graphs. We also explore the effect of graph size and connectivity in terms of this primary research question. Overall, for our tasks, we did not find a significant difference when this clustering is used. However, if the graph is highly connected, these clusterings can improve performance. Also, if the graph is large enough and can be simplified into a few metanodes, benefits in performance on global tasks are realized. Under these same conditions, however, performance of local attribute tasks may be reduced.",Daniel Archambault;Helen C. Purchase;Bruno Pinaud,

We define interactive legends as a class of controls combining the visual representation of static legends and interaction mechanisms of widgets. As interactive legends start to appear in popular websites, we categorize their designs for common data types and evaluate their effectiveness compare to standard widgets. Results suggest that 1) interactive legends can lead to faster perception of the mapping between data values and visual encodings and 2) interaction time is affected differently depending on the data type. Additionally, our study indicates superiority both in terms of perception and interaction of ordinal controls over numerical ones. Numerical techniques are mostly used in today's systems. By providing solutions to allowing users to modify ranges interactively, we believe that interactive legends make it possible to increase the use of ordinal techniques for visual exploration.",Nathalie Henry Riche;Bongshin Lee;Catherine Plaisant,
EuroVis,2010,The Perception of Correlation in Scatterplots,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01694.x,"AbstractWe present a rigorous way to evaluate the visual perception of correlation in scatterplots, based on classical psychophysical methods originally developed for simple properties such as brightness. Although scatterplots are graphically complex, the quantity they convey is relatively simple. As such, it may be possible to assess the perception of correlation in a similar way.Scatterplots were each of 5.0° extent, containing 100 points with a bivariate normal distribution. Means were 0.5 of the range of the points, and standard deviations 0.2 of this range. Precision was determined via an adaptive algorithm to find the just noticeable differences (jnds) in correlation, i.e., the difference between two side‐by‐side scatterplots that could be discriminated 75% of the time. Accuracy was measured by direct estimation, using reference scatterplots with fixed upper and lower values, with a test scatterplot adjusted so that its correlation appeared to be halfway between these. This process was recursively applied to yield several further estimates.Results of the discrimination tests show jnd(r) = k (1/b – r), where r is the Pearson correlation, and parameters 0 &lt; k, b &lt; 1. Integration yields a subjective estimate of correlation g(r) = ln(1 – br) / ln(1 – b). The values of b found via discrimination closely match those found via direct estimation. As such, it appears that the perception of correlation in a scatterplot is completely described by two related performance curves, specified by two easily‐measured parameters.",Ronald A.

EuroVis,2010,Non-iterative Second-order Approximation of Signed Distance Functions for Any Isosurface Representation,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01699.x,"AbstractSigned distance functions (SDF) to explicit or implicit surface representations are intensively used in various computer graphics and visualization algorithms. Among others, they are applied to optimize collision detection, are used to reconstruct data fields or surfaces, and, in particular, are an obligatory ingredient for most level set methods. Level set methods are common in scientific visualization to extract surfaces from scalar or vector fields. Usual approaches for the construction of an SDF to a surface are either based on iterative solutions of a special partial differential equation or on marching algorithms involving a polygonization of the surface. We propose a novel method for a non‐iterative approximation of an SDF and its derivatives in a vicinity of a manifold. We use a second‐order algebraic fitting scheme to ensure high accuracy of the approximation. The manifold is defined (explicitly or implicitly) as an isosurface of a given volumetric scalar field. The field may be given at a set of irregular and unstructured samples. Stability and reliability of the SDF generation is achieved by a proper scaling of weights for the Moving Least Squares approximation, accurate choice of neighbors, and appropriate handling of degenerate cases. We obtain the solution in an explicit form, such that no iterative solving is necessary, which makes our approach fast.",Vladimir Molchanov;Paul Rosenthal;Lars Linsen,
EuroVis,2010,Topology-based Smoothing of 2D Scalar Fields with C1-Continuity,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01702.x,"AbstractData sets coming from simulations or sampling of real‐world phenomena often contain noise that hinders their processing and analysis. Automatic filtering and denoising can be challenging: when the nature of the noise is unknown, it is difficult to distinguish between noise and actual data features; in addition, the filtering process itself may introduce “artificial” features into the data set that were not originally present. In this paper, we propose a smoothing method for 2D scalar fields that gives the user explicit control over the data features. We define features as critical points of the given scalar function, and the topological structure they induce (i.e., the Morse‐Smale complex). Feature significance is rated according to topological persistence. Our method allows filtering out spurious features that arise due to noise by means of topological simplification, providing the user with a simple interface that defines the significance threshold, coupled with immediate visual feedback of the remaining data features. In contrast to previous work, our smoothing method guarantees a C1‐continuous output scalar field with the exact specified features and topological structures.",Tino Weinkauf;Yotam I.

EuroVis,2010,Multi-layer Depth Peeling by Single-Pass Rasterisation for Faster Isosurface Raytracing on GPUs,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01674.x,"AbstractEmpty‐space skipping is an essential acceleration technique for volume rendering. Image‐order empty‐space skipping is not well suited to GPU implementation, since it must perform checks on, essentially, a per‐sample basis, as in kd‐tree traversal, which can lead to a great deal of divergent branching at runtime, which is very expensive in a modern GPU pipeline. In contrast, object‐order empty‐space skipping is extremely fast on a GPU and has negligible overheads compared with approaches without empty‐space skipping, since it employs the hardware unit for rasterisation. However, previous object‐order algorithms have been able to skip only exterior empty space and not the interior empty space that lies inside or between volume objects.In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a multi‐layer depth‐peeling approach that can obtain all of the depth layers of the tight‐fitting bounding geometry of the isosurface by a single rasterising pass. The maximum count of layers peeled by our approach can be up to thousands, while maintaining 32‐bit float‐point accuracy, which was not possible previously. By raytracing only the valid ray segments between each consecutive pair of depth layers, we can skip both the interior and exterior empty space efficiently.In comparisons with 3 state‐of‐the‐art GPU isosurface rendering algorithms, this technique achieved much faster rendering across a variety of data sets.",Baoquan Liu;Gordon Clapworthy;Feng Dong 0005,

Visualizing complex functions is a non‐trivial task since maps between two‐dimensional spaces are involved whose graph would be an unhandy submanifold in four‐dimensional space. The present paper improves the technique of “domain coloring” in several aspects: First, we lift domain coloring from the complex plane to branched Riemann surfaces, which are essentially the correct domain for most complex functions. Second, we extend domain coloring to the visualization of general 2‐valued maps on surfaces. As an application of such general maps we visualize the Gauss map of surfaces as domain colored plots and establish a link to current surface parametrization techniques and texture maps. Third, we adjust the color pattern in domain and in image space to produce higher quality domain colorings. The new color schemes specifically enhance the display of singularities, symmetries and path integrals, and give better qualitative measures of the complex map.",Konstantin Poelke;Konrad Polthier,

To do this, we propose an approach that projects the image of a cell from the spatial domain to the scatterplot domain. We approximate this image using either the convex hull or an axis‐aligned rectangle that forms a tight fit of the projected points. In both cases, the approach relies on subdivision in the spatial domain to control the approximation error introduced in the scatterplot domain. Acceleration of this algorithm in homogeneous regions of the spatial domain is achieved using an octree hierarchy. The algorithm is scalable and adaptive since it allows us to balance computation time and scatterplot quality. We evaluate and discuss the results with respect to accuracy and computational speed.

Points are classified as locally linear, planar, and volumetric structures—according to the eigenvalues of the inverse distance‐weighted covariance matrix at each data element. Based on this classification, different lighting models are applied: codimension‐2 illumination, surface illumination, and emissive volumetric illumination.

To reduce visual clutter caused by line crossings and overlappings in the clustered results, we provide a segment splatter which represents each polyline by one segment and splats these segments with different speeds, colors, and lengths from the leftmost axis to the rightmost axis. Users can interactively control both the polyline splatting and the segment splatting processes to emphasize the features they are interested in.

EuroVis,2009,Instant Volume Visualization using Maximum Intensity Difference Accumulation,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01474.x,"AbstractIt has long been recognized that transfer function setup for Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is crucial to its usability. However, the task of finding an appropriate transfer function is complex and time‐consuming even for experts. Thus, in many practical applications simpler techniques which do not rely on complex transfer functions are employed. One common example is Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) which depicts the maximum value along each viewing ray. In this paper, we introduce Maximum Intensity Difference Accumulation (MIDA), a new approach which combines the advantages of DVR and MIP. Like MIP, MIDA exploits common data characteristics and hence does not require complex transfer functions to generate good visualization results. It does, however, feature occlusion and shape cues similar to DVR. Furthermore, we show that MIDA – in addition to being a useful technique in its own right – can be used to smoothly transition between DVR and MIP in an intuitive manner.

In order to generate time‐varying transfer functions, we search the data for classes that have similar behavior over time, assuming that data points that behave similarly belong to the same feature. We utilize a method we call temporal clustering and sequencing to find dynamic features in value space and create a corresponding transfer function. First, clustering finds groups of data points that have the same value space activity over time. Then, sequencing derives a progression of clusters over time, creating chains that follow value distribution changes. Finally, the cluster sequences are used to create transfer functions, as sequences describe the value range distributions over time in a data set.",Jonathan Woodring;Han-Wei Shen,

Although we know that our universe is not of Gödel type, we can – using this solution to Einstein's equations – visualize and understand the effects resulting from the theory of relativity, which itself has been verified on the large scale in numerous experiments over the last century. We derive the analytical solution to the geodesic equations of Gödel's universe for special initial conditions. Along with programmable graphics hardware we achieve a tremendous speedup for the visualization of general relativity. This enables us to interactively explore the physical aspects and optical effects of Gödel's universe.

EuroVis,2009,MultiClusterTree: Interactive Visual Exploration of Hierarchical Clusters in Multidimensional Multivariate Data,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01468.x,"AbstractVisual analytics of multidimensional multivariate data is a challenging task because of the difficulty in understanding metrics in attribute spaces with more than three dimensions. Frequently, the analysis goal is not to look into individual records but to understand the distribution of the records at large and to find clusters of records with similar attribute values. A large number of (typically hierarchical) clustering algorithms have been developed to group individual records to clusters of statistical significance. However, only few visualization techniques exist for further exploring and understanding the clustering results. We propose visualization and interaction methods for analyzing individual clusters as well as cluster distribution within and across levels in the cluster hierarchy. We also provide a clustering method that operates on density rather than individual records. To not restrict our search for clusters, we compute density in the given multidimensional multivariate space. Clusters are formed by areas of high density. We present an approach that automatically computes a hierarchical tree of high density clusters. To visually represent the cluster hierarchy, we present a 2D radial layout that supports an intuitive understanding of the distribution structure of the multidimensional multivariate data set. Individual clusters can be explored interactively using parallel coordinates when being selected in the cluster tree. Furthermore, we integrate circular parallel coordinates into the radial hierarchical cluster tree layout, which allows for the analysis of the overall cluster distribution. This visual representation supports the comprehension of the relations between clusters and the original attributes. The combination of the 2D radial layout and the circular parallel coordinates is used to overcome the overplotting problem of parallel coordinates when looking into data sets with many records. We apply an automatic coloring scheme based on the 2D radial layout of the hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue, saturation, and value of the HSV color space. The colors support linking the 2D radial layout to other views such as the standard parallel coordinates or, in case data is obtained from multidimensional spatial data, the distribution in object space.",Tran Van Long;Lars Linsen,

Unfortunately, mapping a high‐dimensional data space into a scatterplot involves a loss of information; or, even worse, it can give a misleading picture of valuable structure in higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose class consistency as a measure of the quality of the mapping. Class consistency enforces the constraint that classes of n–D data are shown clearly in 2–D scatterplots. We propose two quantitative measures of class consistency, one based on the distance to the class's center of gravity, and another based on the entropies of the spatial distributions of classes. We performed an experiment where users choose good views, and show that class consistency has good precision and recall.

Our paper provides more control over the rendering process by introducing tighter ray segments for raycasting, while at the same time avoiding the introduction of any new rendering artefacts. We achieve this by dynamically generating, on the GPU, a coarsely fitted proxy geometry, composed of spheres, for the active blocks. The spheres are then rasterised into two z‐buffers by a single rendering pass. The resulting two z‐buffers are used as the first‐hit and last‐hit points for the subsequent raycaster. With this approach, only the valid ray segments between the two z‐buffers need to be sampled during raycasting. This also provides more coherent parallelism on the GPU due to more consistent ray length and avoidance of the overheads and dynamic branching of performing checks on a per‐sample basis during the raycasting pass.Our technique is ideal for dynamic data exploration in which both the transfer function and view parameters need to be changed frequently at runtime. The rendering results of our algorithm are identical to the general cube‐based proxy geometry algorithm, but the performance can be up to 15.7 times faster. Furthermore, the approach can be adopted by any existing raycasting system in a straightforward way.",Baoquan Liu;Gordon Clapworthy;Feng Dong 0005,

One key aspect of volumetric rendering is the ability to provide perceptual cues to aid in understanding structure contained in the data. While shading models that reproduce natural lighting conditions have been shown to better convey depth information and spatial relationships, they traditionally require considerable (pre)computation. In this paper, a shading model for interactive direct volume rendering is proposed that provides perceptual cues similar to those of ambient occlusion, for both solid and transparent surface‐like features. An image space occlusion factor is derived from the radiative transport equation based on a specialized phase function. The method does not rely on any precomputation and thus allows for interactive explorations of volumetric data sets via on‐the‐fly editing of the shading model parameters or (multi‐dimensional) transfer functions while modifications to the volume via clipping planes are incorporated into the resulting occlusion‐based shading.",Mathias Schott;Vincent Pegoraro;Charles D.

Since they are not restricted to star‐ or convex‐shaped geometries, we are able to identify also intricate regions, e.g., of elongated vortices. Computing an integrated value for each loop and mapping these values to a vortex region, introduces new ways for visualizing or filtering the vortex regions.

Our primary goals are the segmentation of different paths through a mixing device and the visualization of ellipsoidal particle deformations. The main challenges are the numerically efficient processing of deformation tensors and the robust integration of stream‐ and streaklines at boundaries of the dataset such that closed segments are obtained. Our results show two‐ and three‐dimensional particle deformations as well as the segmentation of volumes in stationary fields and areas in time‐dependent datasets taking consistent paths through a mixing device.,Harald Obermaier;Martin Hering-Bertram;Jörg Kuhnert;Hans Hagen,

EuroVis,2009,Map Displays for the Analysis of Scalar Data on Cerebral Aneurysm Surfaces,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01459.x,"AbstractCerebral aneurysms result from a congenital or evolved weakness of stabilizing parts of the vessel wall and potentially lead to rupture and a life‐threatening bleeding. Current medical research concentrates on the integration of blood flow simulation results for risk assessment of cerebral aneurysms. Scalar flow characteristics close to the aneurysm surface, such as wall shear stress, form an important part of the simulation results. Aneurysms exhibit variable surface shapes with only few landmarks. Therefore, the exploration and mental correlation of different surface regions is a difficult task. In this paper, we present an approach for the intuitive and interactive overview visualization of near wall flow data that is mapped onto the surface of a 3D model of a cerebral aneurysm. We combine a multi‐perspective 2D projection map with a standard 3D visualization and present techniques to facilitate the correlation between a 3D model and a related 2D map. An informal evaluation with 4 experienced radiologists has shown that the map‐based overview actually improves the surface exploration. Furthermore, different color schemes were discussed and, as a result, an appropriate color scheme for the visual analysis of the wall shear stress is presented.",Mathias Neugebauer;Rocco Gasteiger;Oliver Beuing;Volker Diehl;Martin Skalej;Bernhard Preim,

We have proposed visual metaphors as a framework for understanding high‐level visual structure and its effect on visualization use. Although there is some evidence that visual metaphors can affect visualization use, the nature of this effect is still ambiguous. We propose that a user's preconceived metaphors for data and other individual differences play an important role in her ability to think in a variety of visual metaphors, and subsequently in her ability to use a visualization. We test this hypothesis by conducting a study in which a participant's preconceptions and thinking style were compared with the degree to which she is affected by conflicting metaphors in a visualization and its task questions. The results show that metaphor compatibility has a significant effect on accuracy, but that factors such as spatial ability and personality can lessen this effect. We also find a complex influence of self‐reported metaphor preference on performance. These findings shed light on how people use visual metaphors to understand a visualization.",Caroline Ziemkiewicz;Robert Kosara,

Second, we designed an interactive visual technique, the ‘TbarView’, that allows users to compare multiple schedules within one single view. We evaluated the overlap and TbarView techniques via a user study. The study results showed that our design provided a quick overview of the variances among two or more schedules, and the techniques also improved efficiency by minimizing view switching.

In many application domains these models evolve over time. Only few approaches to visualize such dynamic compound digraphs exist and mostly use animation to show the dynamics. In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node‐link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map.

However, node‐link diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high‐level edge patterns. Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self‐organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high‐level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow.

Also, it supports a much more powerful class of constraint: inequalities or equalities over the Euclidean distance between nodes. We demonstrate the power of this technique by application to a number of diagramming conventions which previous constrained graph layout methods could not support. Further, the constraint‐satisfaction method—inspired by recent work in position‐based dynamics—is far simpler to implement than previous methods.",Tim Dwyer,
EuroVis,2009,Enclosing Surfaces for Point Clusters Using 3D Discrete Voronoi Diagrams,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01448.x,"AbstractPoint clusters occur in both spatial and non‐spatial data. In the former context they may represent segmented particle data, in the latter context they may represent clusters in scatterplots. In order to visualize such point clusters, enclosing surfaces lead to much better comprehension than pure point renderings.We propose a flexible system for the generation of enclosing surfaces for 3D point clusters. We developed a GPU‐based 3D discrete Voronoi diagram computation that supports all surface extractions. Our system provides three different types of enclosing surfaces. By generating a discrete distance field to the point cluster and extracting an isosurface from the field, an enclosing surface with any distance to the point cluster can be generated. As a second type of enclosing surfaces, a hull of the point cluster is extracted. The generation of the hull uses a projection of the discrete Voronoi diagram of the point cluster to an isosurface to generate a polygonal surface. Generated hulls of non‐convex clusters are also non‐convex. The third type of enclosing surfaces can be created by computing a distance field to the hull and extracting an isosurface from the distance field. This method exhibits reduced bumpiness and can extract surfaces arbitrarily close to the point cluster without losing connectedness.We apply our methods to the visualization of multidimensional spatial and non‐spatial data. Multidimensional clusters are extracted and projected into a 3D visual space, where the point clusters are visualized. The respective clusters can also be visualized in object space when dealing with multidimensional particle data.",Paul Rosenthal;Lars Linsen,

We show, for the first time, the equivalence of the standard implementation of the EM‐based reconstruction with an implementation based on hardware‐accelerated volume rendering for nearest‐neighbor (NN) interpolation. This equivalence suggests that higher‐order kernels should be used with caution and do not necessarily lead to better performance. We also show that the EM algorithm can easily be adapted for different lattices, the body‐centered cubic (BCC) one in particular. For validation purposes, we use the 3D version of the Shepp‐Logan synthetic phantom, for which we derive closed‐form analytical expressions of the projection data. The experimental results show the theoretically‐predicted optimality of NN interpolation in combination with the EM algorithm, for both the noiseless and the noisy case. Moreover, reconstruction on the BCC lattice leads to superior accuracy, more compact data representation, and better noise reduction compared to the Cartesian one.

Our work demonstrates that the PLS technique can be adapted to volumetric dye advection via streak volumes, and to the visualization by time surfaces and path volumes. We achieve this with a modified and extended PLS, including a model for dye injection. A new algorithmic interpretation of PLS is introduced to exploit the efficiency of the GPU, leading to interactive visualization.

The evolution of dye patterns in the flow field is achieved by advecting individual control volumes, which collectively cover the entire spatial domain. The local variation of dye material, represented as a piecewise quasi‐parabolic function, is integrated within each control volume resulting in mass conserving transport without excessive numerical diffusion.

To efficiently reduce this enormous amount of information, local statistical complexity was recently introduced as a method that identifies distinctive structures using concepts from information theory. Due to high computational costs this method was so far limited to 2D data.

The bottleneck of the original method is the division of spatio‐temporal configurations in the field (light‐cones) into different classes of behavior. The new algorithm uses a density‐driven Voronoi tessellation for this task that more accurately captures the distribution of configurations in the sparsely sampled high‐dimensional space. The efficient computation is achieved using structures and algorithms from graph theory.

EuroVis,2008,Computing Local Signed Distance Fields for Large Polygonal Models,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01210.x,"AbstractThe signed distance field for a polygonal model is a useful representation that facilitates efficient computation in many visualization and geometric processing tasks. Often it is more effective to build a local distance field only within a narrow band around the surface that holds local geometric information for the model. In this paper, we present a novel technique to construct a volumetric local signed distance field of a polygonal model. To compute the local field efficiently, exactly those cells that cross the polygonal surface are found first through a new voxelization method, building a list of intersecting triangles for each boundary cell. After their neighboring cells are classified, the triangle lists are exploited to compute the local signed distance field with minimized voxel‐to‐triangle distance computations. While several efficient methods for computing the distance field, particularly those harnessing the graphics processing unit's (GPU's) processing power, have recently been proposed, we focus on a CPU‐based technique, intended to deal flexibly with large polygonal models and high‐resolution grids that are often too bulky for GPU computation.",Byungjoon Chang;Deukhyun Cha;Insung Ihm,

Current graphics hardware accelerated algorithms are approximating approaches, where the final triangulation is usually performed through either marching cubes or marching tetrahedras.

EuroVis,2008,Interaction-Dependent Semantics for Illustrative Volume Rendering,10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01216.x,"AbstractIn traditional illustration the choice of appropriate styles and rendering techniques is guided by the intention of the artist. For illustrative volume visualizations it is difficult to specify the mapping between the 3D data and the visual representation that preserves the intention of the user. The semantic layers concept establishes this mapping with a linguistic formulation of rules that directly map data features to rendering styles. With semantic layers fuzzy logic is used to evaluate the user defined illustration rules in a preprocessing step.In this paper we introduce interaction‐dependent rules that are evaluated for each frame and are therefore computationally more expensive. Enabling interaction‐dependent rules, however, allows the use of a new class of semantics, resulting in more expressive interactive illustrations. We show that the evaluation of the fuzzy logic can be done on the graphics hardware enabling the efficient use of interaction‐dependent semantics. Further we introduce the flat rendering mode and discuss how different rendering parameters are influenced by the rule base. Our approach provides high quality illustrative volume renderings at interactive frame rates, guided by the specification of illustration rules.",Peter Rautek;Stefan Bruckner;M. Eduard Gröller,

The visualization method presented in this paper addresses these issues by using a hybrid combination of polygonal rendering of brain structures and direct volume rendering of activation data. Advanced rendering techniques including illustrative display styles and ambient occlusion calculations enhance the clarity of the visual output. The presented rendering pipeline produces real‐time frame rates and offers a high degree of configurability.

In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct dendrites using a surface representation of the dendrite. The 1‐D skeleton of the dendritic surface is then extracted by a medial geodesic function that is robust and topologically correct. This is followed by a Bayesian identification and classification of the spines.

The integration requires visualization approaches besides traditional clustering and statistical analysis methods. Our application can (i) visualize the data from time series experiments in the context of a regulatory network and KEGG metabolic pathways; (ii) identify and visualize active regulatory subnetworks from the gene expression data; (iii) perform a statistical test to identify and subsequently visualize pathways that are affected by differentially expressed genes.

The data analysts want to catch problems in flight to reveal the root cause of anomalies. Immediate actions need to be taken before the problems become too expensive or consume too many resources. In the meantime, analysts need to have the “big picture” of what the information is about. In this paper, we derive and analyze two real‐time visualization techniques for managing density displays: (1) circular overlay d isplays which visualize large volumes of data without data shift movements after the display is full, thus freeing the analyst from adjusting the mental picture of the data after each data shift; and (2) variable resolution density displays which allow users to get the entire view without cluttering. We evaluate these techniques with respect to a number of evaluation measures, such as constancy of the display and usage of display space, and compare them to conventional d isplays with periodic shifts. Our real time data monitoring system also provides advanced interactions such as a local root cause analysis for further exploration.

We introduce a concept for the coupling of data classification and interactive visualization in order to make this transformation visible and steerable for the human user. Data classification techniques generate mappings that formally group data items into categories. Interactive visualization includes the user into an iterative refinement process. The user identifies and selects interesting patterns to define these categories. The following step is the transformation of a visible pattern into the formal definition of a classifier. In the last step the classifier is transformed back into a pattern that is blended with the original data in the same visual display. Our approach allows in intuitive assessment of a formal classifier and its model, the detection of outliers and the handling of noisy data using visual pattern‐matching. We instantiated the concept using decision trees for classification and KVMaps as the visualization technique.

However, due to the size and complexity of the data, identifying terrorists' patterns and trends has been difficult. To better enable investigators in understanding terrorist activities, we propose a visual analytical system that focuses on depicting one of the most fundamental concepts in investigative analysis, the five W's (who, what, where, when, and why). Views in our system are highly correlated, and each represents one of the W's. With this approach, an investigator can interactively explore terrorist activities efficiently and discover reasons of attacks (why) by identifying patterns temporally (when), geo‐spatially (where), between multiple terrorist groups (who), and across different methods or modes of attacks (what). By coupling a global perspective with the details gleaned from asking these five questions, the system allows analysts to think both tactically and strategically.",Xiaoyu Wang 0001;Erin Miller;Kathleen Smarick;William Ribarsky;Remco Chang,

The use of molecular dynamics simulations allows detailed studies of complex protein‐solvent interactions. Cluster analysis and density‐based approaches have been successfully used for the identification and analysis of conserved water molecules and hydration patterns of proteins. However, appropriate tools for analysing long‐time molecular dynamics simulations with respect to tracking and visualising the paths of solvent molecules are lacking. Our method focuses on visualising the solvent paths entering and leaving cavities of the protein and allows to study the route and dynamics of the exchange of tightly bound internal water molecules with the bulk solvent. The proposed visualisation also represents dynamic properties such as direction and velocity in the solvent. Especially, by clustering similar path‐lines with respect to designated properties the visualisation can be abstracted to represent the principal paths of solvent molecules through the cavities.

Pathways are represented as large collections of interwoven graphs, with complex structures present in both the individual graphs and their interconnections. This situation requires the development of novel visualization techniques to allow efficient visual exploration. We present the Caleydo framework, which incorporates a number of approaches to handle such pathways. Navigation in the network of pathways is facilitated by a hierarchical approach which dynamically selects a working set of individual pathways for closer inspection. These pathways are interactively rendered together with visual interconnections in a 2.5D view using graphics hardware acceleration. The layout of individual graphs is not computed automatically, but taken from the KEGG and BioCarta databases, which use layouts that life scientists are familiar with. Therefore they encode essential meta‐information. While the KEGG and BioCarta pathways use a pre‐defined layout, interactions such as linking+brushing, neighborhood search or detail on demand are still fully interactive in Caleydo. We have evaluated Caleydo with pathologists working on the determination of unknown gene functions. Informal experiences confirm that Caleydo is useful in both generating and validating such hypotheses.Even though the presented techniques are applied to medical pathways, the proposed way of interaction is not limited to cellular processes and therefore has the potential to open new possibilities in other fields of application.",Marc Streit;Michael Kalkusch;Karl Kashofer;Dieter Schmalstieg,

We describe a general system pipeline that combines ontology mapping and probabilistic reasoning techniques. With this approach, a web page is first mapped to a Domain Ontology, which stores the semantics of a specific subject domain (e.g., music charts). The Domain Ontology is then mapped to one or more Visual Representation Ontologies, each of which captures the semantics of a visualization style (e.g., tree maps). To enable the mapping between these two ontologies, we establish a Semantic Bridging Ontology, which specifies the appropriateness of each semantic bridge. Finally each Visual Representation Ontology is mapped to a visualization using an external visualization toolkit. Using this approach, we have developed a prototype software tool, SemViz, as a realisation of this approach. By interfacing its Visual Representation Ontologies with public domain software such as ILOG Discovery and Prefuse, SemViz is able to generate appropriate visualizations automatically from a large collection of popular web pages for music charts without prior knowledge of these web pages.",O.

This paper describes a solution to this problem, which uses a global edge metric to determine a subset of edges that capture the graph's intrinsic clustering structure. This structure is then used to create an embedding of the graph, after which the remaining edges are added back in.

The basic algorithm consists of the following stages: (1) λ2 field construction and isosurface extraction; (2) computation of the curve skeleton of the λ2 isosurface to build an initial prediction for the core line; (3) correction of the locations of the prediction by searching for λ2 minima on planes perpendicular to the core line. In particular, we consider the topology of the vortex core lines, guaranteeing the same topology as the initial curve skeleton. Furthermore, we propose a geometry‐guided definition of vortex bifurcation, which represents the split of one core line into two parts. Finally, we introduce a user‐guided approach in order to narrow down vortical regions taking into account the graph of λ2 along the computed vortex core line. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing our results to previous core line detection methods with both simulated and experimental data; in particular, we show robustness of our method for noise‐affected data.",Tobias Schafhitzel;Joachim E.

However, the effectiveness of this technique on large data is reduced by edge clutter. In this paper, we present a novel framework to reduce edge clutter, consequently improving the effectiveness of visual clustering. We exploit curved edges and optimize the arrangement of these curved edges by minimizing their curvature and maximizing the parallelism of adjacent edges. The overall visual clustering is improved by adjusting the shape of the edges while keeping their relative order. The experiments on several representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",Hong Zhou 0004;Xiaoru Yuan;Huamin Qu;Weiwei Cui;Baoquan Chen,

These methods allow surgeons to explore multimodal volumes and focus on functional data and lesions. Computer graphics techniques are proposed to create expressive visualizations at interactive frame rates to reduce time‐consuming and complex interaction with the medical data. Contributions of our work are the distance‐based enhancements of functional data and lesions which allows the surgeon to perceive functional and anatomical structures at once and relate them directly to the intervention. In addition we propose methods for the visual exploration of the path to the structures of interest, to enhance anatomical landmarks, and to provide additional depth indicators.

In this work, we aim at supporting the visual analysis of classical streamlines from fiber tracking by integrating context from anatomical data, acquired by a T1‐weighted MRI measurement. To this end, we suggest a novel visualization metaphor, which is based on data‐driven deformation of geometry and has been inspired by a technique for anatomical fiber preparation known as Klingler dissection. We demonstrate that our method conveys the relation between streamlines and surrounding anatomical features more effectively than standard techniques like slice images and direct volume rendering.

Fiber clustering groups the DTI fibers into spatially and anatomically related tracts. As an increasing number of fiber clustering methods have been recently developed, it is important to display, compare, and explore the clustering results efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we present an anatomical visualization technique that reduces the geometric complexity of the fiber tracts and emphasizes the high‐level structures. Beginning with a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we first construct a hierarchical clustering representation of the fiber bundles. These bundles are then reformulated into a 3D multi‐valued volume data. We then build a set of geometric hulls and principal fibers to approximate the shape and orientation of each fiber bundle. By simultaneously visualizing the geometric hulls, individual fibers, and other data sets such as fractional anisotropy, the overall shape of the fiber tracts are highlighted, while preserving the fibrous details. A rater with expert knowledge of white matter structure has evaluated the resulting interactive illustration and confirmed the improvement over straightforward DTI fiber tract visualization.",Wei Chen 0001;Song Zhang 0004;Stephen Correia;David S.

In financial data analysis, however, analysts still primarily rely on a set of statistical performance parameters in combination with traditional line charts in order to evaluate assets and to make decisions, and information visualization is only very slowly entering this important domain. In this paper, we analyze some of the standard statistical measures for technical financial data analysis and demonstrate cases where they produce insufficient and misleading results that do not reflect the real performance of an asset. We propose a technique for visualizing financial time series data that eliminates these inadequacies, offering a complete view on the real performance of an asset. The technique is enhanced by relevance and weighting functions according to the users' preferences in order to emphasize specific regions of interest. Based on these principles we redefine some of the standard performance measures.

We address the problem of visualizing large time-related data sets which are difficult to visualize effectively with standard techniques given the limitations of current display devices. We propose a framework for intelligent time- and data-dependent visual aggregation of data along multiple resolution levels. This idea leads to effective visualization support for long time-series data providing both focus and context. The basic idea of the technique is that either data-dependent or application-dependent, display space is allocated in proportion to the degree of interest of data subintervals, thereby (a) guiding the user in perceiving important information, and (b) freeing required display space to visualize all the data. The automatic part of the framework can accommodate any time series analysis algorithm yielding a numeric degree of interest scale.

EuroVis,2007,Manual Clustering Refinement using Interaction with Blobs,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/059-066,"The huge amount of different automatic clustering methods emphasizes one thing: there is no optimal clustering method for all possible cases. In certain application domains, like genomics and natural language processing, it is not even clear if any of the already known clustering methods suffice. In such cases, an automatic clustering method is often followed by manual refinement. The refined version may then be used as either an illustration, a reference, or even an input for a rule based or other machine learning algorithm as a new clustering method. In this paper, we describe a novel interaction technique to manual cluster refinement using the metaphor of soap bubbles, represented by special implicit surfaces (blobs). For instance, entities can simply be moved inside and outside of these blobs. A modified force-directed layout process automatically arranges entities equidistant on the screen. The modifications include a reduction to the expected amount of computation per iteration down to O(|V| log |V|+|E|) in order to achieve a high response time for use in an interactive system. We also spend a considerable amount of effort making the display of blobs fast enough for an interactive system.",Christian Heine 0002;Gerik Scheuermann,

Steerability allows exploration to begin immediately, rather than requiring a costly layout of the entire graph as an initial step. In a feature-based approach, the subgraph inside a metanode of the graph hierarchy is laid out with a well- chosen algorithm appropriate for its topological structure. Grouse preserves the input hierarchy, which provides meaningful information to the user when its metanodes correspond to features of interest. When a metanode in the hierarchy is opened, a limited number of metanodes are laid out again along the path between the opened node and the root. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grouse on datasets from IMDB, the Internet Movie Database, where nodes are actors and cliques represent movies. The combination of feature-based layout and limited relayout computation does not fragment features in the hierarchy and improves the number of levels in the hierarchy that can be seen at once over previous approaches.",Daniel Archambault;Tamara Munzner;David Auber,

Additionally, we enable variable means of interactivity during story playback. The story observers may just watch the presentation passively, but they are also allowed to reinvestigate the visualization independently from story guidance, offering the ability to verify, confirm, or even disapprove the presented visualization message.

In order to analyze and understand such data, scientists need the capability to explore simultaneously in the temporal, spatial, and variable domains of the data. Such capability, however, is not generally provided by conventional visualization tools. This paper presents a new visualization interface addressing this problem. The interface consists of three components which abstracts the complexity of exploring in temporal, variable, and spatial domain, respectively. The first component displays time histograms of the data, helps the user identify timesteps of interest, and also helps specify time-varying features. The second component displays correlations between variables in parallel coordinates and enables the user to verify those correlations and possibly identity unanticipated ones. The third component allows the user to more closely explore and validate the data in spatial domain while rendering multiple variables into a single visualization in a user controllable fashion. Each of these three components is not only an interface but is also the visualization itself, thus enabling efficient screen-space usage. The three components are tightly linked to facilitate tri-space data exploration, which offers scientists new power to study their time-varying, multivariate volume data.",Hiroshi Akiba;Kwan-Liu Ma,

On the other hand, multidimensional transfer functions can perform more sophisticated data classification, based on vectorial voxel signatures. The transfer function design is a non-trivial and unintuitive task, especially in the multi-dimensional case.

In VS, volumes are commonly represented as a space-filling set of deformed polyhedra, which can be further decomposed into a mesh of tetrahedra for rendering. Images can then be generated via tetrahedral projection or raycasting. A current shortcoming in VS-based operations is the need for a very high level of subdivision to represent fine detail in the mesh and to obtain a high-fidelity visualization. However, we have discovered that the subdivision process itself can be closely simulated with radial basis functions (RBFs), making it possible to replace the finer subdivision levels by a coarser aggregation of RBF kernels. This reduction to a simplified assembly of RBFs subsequently enables interactive rendering of volumetric subdivision shapes within a GPU-based volume splatting framework.",Kevin T.

The output of the device is a multi-spectral datacube; a three-dimensional (3D) dataset in which the xy-dimension represents the surface position and the z-dimension represents the mass spectral distribution. Analysts try to discover correlations in spectral profiles and spatial distributions inside a datacube. New technological developments allow mass spectrometric imaging on a higher spatial and spectral resolution. In this paper we present a parametric visualization technique which allows an analyst to examine spectral and spatially correlated patterns on the highest possible resolution. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to decompose the datacube into several discriminating components. We represent these extracted features as abstract geometric shapes and use three parameters to allow for data exploration. The first parameter thresholds the spectral contribution at which an extracted component is visualized. The level of detail the shapes is controlled by a second parameter and a third parameter determines at which density-level the extracted feature is represented. This new visualization technique enables an analyst to select the most relevant spectral correlations and investigate their specific spatial distribution.

This decoupling of the line direction from the direction of animation allows us to choose the spatial frequencies along the direction of motion independently from the length scales along the LIC line patterns. Vision research indicates that local motion detectors are tuned to certain spatial frequencies of textures, and the above decoupling enables us to generate spatial frequencies optimized for motion perception. In addition, a filtering process is described to achieve a consistent and temporally coherent animation of the orthogonal vector field visualization.

In regions, which are interesting the streamlines are drawn with increased density, while less interesting regions are drawn sparsely.

The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order to apply stippling textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our stippling technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the stippling process enables stippling for several complex objects simultaneously.

We propose a novel dual-core approach to asynchronously stream such fields from the CPU, thus enabling the efficient exploration of large time-resolved sequences. This approach decouples visualization from data handling, resulting in interactive frame rates. Built upon a previously published GPU particle engine for flow visualization we have developed new strategies to compute and to visualize path lines and streak lines on the GPU. To provide additional visual cues, focus+context techniques for polygonal meshes have been integrated. The proposed techniques are used in the visual analysis of the Terashake 2.1 earthquake simulation data, and they have been shown to be very effective in revealing the relevant information in this data.",Kai Bürger;Jens Schneider 0002;Polina Kondratieva;Jens H.

EuroVis,2007,Functional Unit Maps for Data-Driven Visualization of High-Density EEG Coherence,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis07/259-266,"Synchronous electrical activity in different brain regions is generally assumed to imply functional relationships between these regions. A measure for this synchrony is electroencephalography (EEG) coherence, computed between pairs of signals as a function of frequency. Existing high-density EEG coherence visualizations are generally either hypothesis-driven, or data-driven graph visualizations which are cluttered. In this paper, a new method is presented for data-driven visualization of high-density EEG coherence, which strongly reduces clutter and is referred to as functional unit (FU) map. Starting from an initial graph, with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing significant coherences between electrode signals, we define an FU as a set of electrodes represented by a clique consisting of spatially connected vertices. In an FU map, the spatial relationship between electrodes is preserved, and all electrodes in one FU are assigned an identical gray value. Adjacent FUs are visualized with different gray values and FUs are connected by a line if the average coherence between FUs exceeds a threshold. Results obtained with our visualization are in accordance with known electrophysiological findings. FU maps can be used as a preprocessing step for conventional analysis.",Michael ten Caat;Natasha M.

The interactive exploration of a scene with 3d objects involves the systematic analysis of several anatomic structures. Viewpoint selection techniques enhance the display of the currently selected structure. For animations in collaborative intervention planning and surgical education, the authoring process may be significantly enhanced if 'good' viewpoints for important objects as well as for the whole scene are chosen automatically. We describe a viewpoint selection technique guided by parameters like size of unoccluded surface, importance of occluding objects, preferred region and viewpoint stability. The influence of these parameters may be flexibly adjusted by weights. Parameter maps indicate the influence of the current parameter settings on the viewpoints. For selected applications, the weights may be predefined and reused for other cases. We also describe an informal user study which was accomplished to understand if our viewpoint selection strategies produce adequate results from the users' point of view.",Konrad Mühler;Mathias Neugebauer;Christian Tietjen;Bernhard Preim,

However, it is difficult to provide a fused visualization that allows sufficient spatial perception of the anatomy of interest, as derived from the rich pre-operative scan, while not occluding the real-time image displayed embedded within the volume. 
 
We propose an importance-driven approach that presents the embedded data such that it is clearly visible along with its spatial relation to the surrounding volumetric material. To support this, we present and integrate novel techniques for importance specification, feature emphasis, and contextual cutaway generation. We show results in a clinical context where a pre-operative CT scan is visualized alongside a tracked ultrasound image, such that the important vasculature is depicted between the viewpoint and the ultrasound image, while a more opaque representation of the anatomy is exposed in the surrounding area.",Michael Burns;Martin Haidacher;Wolfgang Wein;Ivan Viola;M.

A variety of techniques has been developed which provide smooth high-quality visualizations of vascular structures based on rather simple model assumptions. For diagnostic applications, these model assumptions and the resulting deviations from the actual vessel surface are not acceptable. We present a model-free approach which employs the binary result of a prior vessel segmentation as input. Instead of directly converting the segmentation result into a surface, we compute a point cloud which is adaptively refined at thin structures, where aliasing effects are particularly obvious and artifacts may occur. The point cloud is transformed into a surface representation by means of MPU Implicits, which provide a smooth piecewise quadratic approximation. Our method has been applied to a variety of datasets including pathologic cases. The generated visualizations are considerably more accurate than model-based approaches.

We also exploit the advantages of PSS to propose a novel technique for extracting surfaces directly from volumetric data. This technique is based on the well known predictor-corrector principle from the numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations. Our technique provides good approximations to surfaces defined by a certain property in the volume, such as iso-surfaces or surfaces located at regions of high gradient magnitude. Also, local details of the surfaces could be manipulated by changing the local polynomial approximation and the smoothing parameters used.

This reduces the load on the CPU that would otherwise need to provide a suitable level-of-detail representation of the scene, while offering even higher quality in the resulting surfaces since every fragment is traced individually. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing it to the performance and output of conventional visualization tools in the application area of diffusion tensor imaging of human brain MR scans.

Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no isosurface extraction method exists that directly extracts surfaces from scattered volume data without 3D mesh generation or reconstruction over a structured grid. We propose a method based on spatial domain partitioning using a kd-tree and an indexing scheme for efficient neighbor search. Our approach consists of a geometry extraction and a rendering step. The geometry extraction step computes points on the isosurface by linearly interpolating between neighboring pairs of samples. The neighbor information is retrieved by partitioning the 3D domain into cells using a kd-tree. The cells are merely described by their index and bitwise index operations allow for a fast determination of potential neighbors. We use an angle criterion to select appropriate neighbors from the small set of candidates. The output of the geometry step is a point cloud representation of the isosurface. The final rendering step uses point-based rendering techniques to visualize the point cloud. 
 
Our direct isosurface extraction algorithm for scattered volume data produces results of quality close to the results from standard isosurface extraction algorithms for gridded volume data (like marching cubes).

They acquire the knowledge of the access history and patterns dynamically, and adapt their prefetching strategies accordingly. We have compared the algorithms with a demand-based algorithm, as well as a more domain-specific out-of-core algorithm. We carried out our evaluation in conjunction with an example application where rendering multiple point sets in a volume scene graph put a great strain on the rendering algorithm in terms of memory management. Our results have shown that the knowledge-based approach offers a better cache-hit to disk-access trade-off.

Our goal was to come up with a method that falls into the first category, yet reveals structural information. We have developed a dense flow visualization method that shows the overall flow behavior while accentuating structural information without performing a topological analysis. Our method is based on a geometry-based flow integration step and a texture-based visual exploration step. The flow integration step generates a density field, which is written into a texture. The density field is generated by tracing particles under the influence of the underlying vector field. When using a quasi-random seeding strategy for initialization, the resulting density is high in attracting regions and low in repelling regions. Density is measured by the number of particles per region accumulated over time. We generate one density field using forward and one using backward propagation. The density fields are explored using texture-based rendering techniques. We generate the two output images separately and blend the results, which allows us to distinguish between inflow and outflow regions. We obtained dense flow visualizations that display the overall flow behavior, emphasize critical and separating regions, and indicate flow direction in the neighborhood of these regions.

In financial analysis, however, the most important and most common visualization techniques for time series data is the traditional line- or bar chart. Although these are intuitive and make it easy to spot the effect of key events on a asset's price, and its return over a given period of time, price charts do not allow the easy perception of relative movements in terms of growth rates, which is the key feature of any price-related time series. 
 
This paper presents a novel Growth Matrix visualization technique for analyzing assets. It extends the ability of existing chart techniques by not only visualizing asset return rates over fixed time frames, but over the full spectrum of all subintervals present in a given time frame, in a single view. At the same time, the technique allows a comparison of subinterval return rates among groups of even a few hundreds of assets. This provides a powerful way for analyzing financial data, since it allows the identification of strong and weak periods of assets as compared to global market characteristics, and thus allows a more encompassing visual classification into ""good"" and ""poor"" performers than existing chart techniques. We illustrate the technique by real-world examples showing the abilities of the new approach, and its high relevance for financial analysis tasks.",Daniel A.

PointCloudXplore uses the established visualization techniques of multiple views, brushing, and linking to support the analysis of high-dimensional datasets that describe many genes' expression. Each of the views in PointCloud- Xplore shows a different gene expression data property. Brushing is used to select and emphasize data associated with defined subsets of embryo cells within a view. Linking is used to show in additional views the expression data for a group of cells that have first been highlighted as a brush in a single view, allowing further data subset properties to be determined. In PointCloudXplore, physical views of the data are linked to parallel coordinates. Physical views show the spatial relationships between different genes' expression patterns within the embryo. Parallel coordinates, on the other hand, show only some features of each gene's expression, but allow simultaneous analysis of data for many more genes than would be possible in a physical view.

EuroVis,2006,D2VR: High-Quality Volume Rendering of Projection-based Volumetric Data,10.2312/VisSym/EuroVis06/211-218,"Volume rendering techniques are conventionally classified as either direct or indirect methods. Indirect methods require to transform the initial volumetric model into an intermediate geometrical model in order to efficiently visualize it. In contrast, direct volume rendering (DVR) methods can directly process the volumetric data. Modern CT scanners usually provide data as a set of samples on a rectilinear grid, which is computed from the measured projections by discrete tomographic reconstruction. Therefore the rectilinear grid can already be considered as an intermediate volume representation. In this paper we introduce direct direct volume rendering (D2VR). D2VR does not require a rectilinear grid, since it is based on an immediate processing of the measured projections. Arbitrary samples for ray casting are reconstructed from the projections by using the Filtered Back-Projection algorithm. Our method removes a lossy resampling step from the classical volume rendering pipeline. It provides much higher accuracy than traditional grid-based resampling techniques do.

We evaluate new algorithms for rendering tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. In each algorithm, the first cell along a ray is found using common realtime ray tracing techniques. For traversing subsequent cells within the volume, Plucker coordinates as well as ray-bilinear patch intersection tests are used. Since the volume is rendered directly, all algorithms are applicable for isosurface rendering, maximum-intensity projection, and emissionabsorption models.",Gerd Marmitt;Philipp Slusallek,

Furthermore, it has a major influence on the efficiency of the visualization process. We have developed a framework that facilitates the semi-automatic design of transfer functions. Similarly to other approaches we generate clusters in the transfer function domain. We created a real-time interaction with a hierarchy of clusters. This interaction effectively substitutes cumbersome settings of clustering thresholds. Our framework is also able to easily combine different clustering criteria. 
 
We have developed two similarity measures for clustering of material boundaries. One is based on the similarity of the boundaries in the transfer function domain and the other on their spatial relation. We use the LH space as the transfer function domain. This space facilitates the clustering of material boundaries. We demonstrate our approach on several examples.",Petr Sereda;Anna Vilanova;Frans A. Gerritsen,

The proposed method smoothly interpolates between blocks of arbitrary block-wise level-of-detail (LOD) without sample replication or padding. This permits extreme changes in resolution across block boundaries and removes the interblock dependency for the LOD creation process. In addition the full data reduction from the LOD selection can be maintained throughout the rendering pipeline.

We then evaluated these visualization forms with regard to their effectiveness in experimental field studies. The field tests were carried out to measure the operators' performance in early detection of insulation damages on lime kilns. The results we obtained from the study show that the two new forms of 3D visualization lead to a reduction of the detection times by about two-thirds and one-third, respectively, when compared to the conventional 2D map representation.

Most segmentation techniques yield a model without indicating any uncertainty. Visualization then can be misleading, especially if the original data is of poor contrast. 
 
We address this dilemma proposing a geometric approach based on distance on image manifolds and an alternative approach based on nonlinear diffusion. An effective algorithm solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations allows for computing a distance function for 2D and 3D manifolds at interactive rates. An efficient implementation of a semi-implicit operator splitting scheme accomplishes interactivity for the diffusion-based strategy.

This tiled organization employs a two-dimensional row-column representation, rather than a one-dimensional arrangement in columns as used for the classical parallel coordinates. The usefulness of the new method, referred to as tiled parallel coordinates, is demonstrated by one particular type of EEG data.

The context-preserving volume rendering model uses a function of shading intensity, gradient magnitude, distance to the eye point, and previously accumulated opacity to selectively reduce the opacity in less important data regions.

We demonstrate that deferred filtering overcomes this problem by using a two-pass decompression and rendering strategy. With this method interpolation and gradient calculations are very efficient, allowing high quality rendering directly from packed or compressed volume data.

Training with simulator is generally low in cost and more efficient than traditional methods that involve supervised learning on actual patients. Incorporating genuine patient data in the simulation can significantly improve the efficacy of training and skills assessment. In this paper, a photo-realistic simulation architecture is described that utilises patient-specific models for training in minimally invasive surgery. The datasets are constructed by combining computer tomographic images with bronchoscopy video of the same patient so that the three dimensional structures and visual appearance are accurately matched. Using simulators enriched by a library of datasets with sufficient patient variability, trainees can experience a wide range of realistic scenarios, including rare pathologies, with correct visual information. In this paper, the matching of CT and video data is accomplished by using a newly developed 2D/3D registration method that exploits a shape from shading similarity measure. Additionally, a method has been devised to allow shading parameter estimation by modelling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the visible surfaces. The derived BRDF is then used to predict the expected shading intensity such that a texture map independent of lighting conditions can be extracted. Thus new views can be generated that were not captured in the original bronchoscopy video, thus allowing free navigation of the acquired 3D model with enhanced photo-realism.",Adrian James Chung;Fani Deligianni;Pallav L.

This subset, called a seed-set, has the property that every iso-surface must intersect with it, and it could be built at the preprocessing time. When an iso-value is given at the run time, iso-contouring algorithm starts from the intersected cells in the seed-set, and gradually propagates to form the whole iso-surface. As smaller seed-sets offer less cell searching time, most existing iso-contouring algorithms concentrates on how to identify an optimal seed-set. In this paper, we propose a new and linear-time approach for seed-set construction.

Our approach allows domain experts to visualize the results of molecular dynamics simulations with a higher number of particles than before and furthermore offers much better visual quality. We achieve this by transferring only visualization parameters to the GPU and by generating implicit surfaces directly in the fragment program. As a result, we can render up to 500.000 glyphs with about 10 fps displaying all the simulation results as geometrical properties that resemble the classical abstract representation used in this research area. Thus we enable researchers to visually assess the results of simulations of greater scale than before.

While several optimal methods have been proposed to accelerate isosurface extraction, these algorithms are relatively complicated to implement or require quantized values as input. Our method is based on a straightforward array data structure that only requires an auxiliary sorting routine for construction.

Firstly, time does not allow for leaving certain messages unanswered for a long time, and in certain cases, for reading all messages. Secondly, the dilemma of electronic filters leaves a choice of too many junk mails getting through versus a risk of solicited mails being dumped.

It combines classical visual analytics (help to identify pattern such as peaks and trends over time) with geo-spatial map distortions (help to understand the routes of e-mails).

The complexity of such mapping often makes it difficult for a user to manually explore and manipulate the design parameter space to produce the desired output. Computer assistance is therefore useful in setting the mapping parameter values to generate desired outputs. Existing systems rely on exploring the entire input parameter space, which can be time and resource-intensive, particularly if the number of input parameters is large. We introduce a new approach to handling a large number of mapping parameters more efficiently. The basis for our approach is the identification of a small and effective set of highlevel parameters that can be associated directly with the characteristics of the outputs. Users will have a better understanding of this small set of high-level parameters and can easily modify their values interactively to produce the desired outputs.

However, its deployment in everyday clinical use has so far been limited. Two major challenges are that the current methods for Transfer Function (TF) construction are too complex and that the tissue separation abilities of the TF need to be extended. In this paper we propose the use of histogram analysis in local neighborhoods to address both these conflicting problems. To reduce TF construction difficulty, we introduce Partial Range Histograms in an automatic tissue detection scheme, which in connection with Adaptive Trapezoids enable efficient TF design. To separate tissues with overlapping intensity ranges, we propose a fuzzy classification based on local histograms as a second TF dimension.

Using this information we can easily classify the histogram and derive a transfer function by assigning unique colors to each class of the histogram.

Instead, tessellation happens 'justin- time' given a certain camera position, image size and interaction demand. Thus, our approach is based on multiresolution meshes and on new extensions of graphics hardware. The paper shows how to reduce geometric data by using subdivision surfaces for ribbon structures and molecular surfaces and by using billboards instead of spheres consisting of triangles. It also shows how to use fragment shaders to create a three dimensional appearance and realistic sphere intersections.

We propose methods to speed up lookup table generation and minimize lighting artifacts. The incremental subrange integration method we describe allows interactive lookup table generation in O(n2) time without the need for approximation or hardware assistance.

Since the radial basis functions (RBFs) we use for encoding can provide a compact representation of volumetric scalar fields, the large grid/mesh traditionally needed for rendering is no longer required and ceases to be a data transfer and computational bottleneck during rendering. Our new approach will interactively render RBF encoded data obtained from arbitrary volume data sets, including both structured volume models and unstructured scattered volume models.

EuroVis,2004,Boundary Switch Connectors for Topological Visualization of Complex 3D Vector Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/183-192,"One of the reasons that topological methods have a limited popularity for the visualization of complex 3D flow fields is the fact that their topological structures contain a number of separating stream surfaces. Since these stream surfaces tend to hide each other as well as other topological features, for complex 3D topologies the visualizations become cluttered and hardly interpretable. One solution of this problem is the recently introduced concept of saddle connectors which treats separation surfaces emanating from critical points. In this paper we extend this concept to separation surfaces starting from boundary switch curves. This way we obtain a number of particular stream lines called boundary switch connectors. They connect either two boundary switch curves or a boundary switch curve with a saddle. We discuss properties and computational issues of boundary switch connectors and apply them to topologically complex flow data.",Tino Weinkauf;Holger Theisel;Hans-Christian Hege;Hans-Peter Seidel,

Through not only visualization but also auralization, users may have better understandings of the data, especially when it is visually complicated. In this work, a field auralization technique is introduced, which objective is at the sound synthesis from field information represented as 3D time-varying volume data. Our technique takes a hybrid approach between parameter mapping and direct simulation. During preprocessing, acoustic strengths are computed at each vertex at each time step of volume data. During interaction, users navigate within the volume space and audio frames are computed by integrating the radiations from the sources. A number of problems inherent in this problem and our solutions are discussed.",Youngin Shin;Chandrajit L. Bajaj,

The advantages of this approach is that a curved element can be directly visualized. Conventionally, higher-order elements are tessellated with several linear elements so that standard visualization techniques can be applied to the linear elements. Our method primarily focuses on how to find an approximation to the intersection between a ray and a curved-quadratic element. Once this approximation is found, conventional accumulation and color mapping techniques can be applied to the approximation to produce a volumetric visualization of the element. A cutting plane implementation is also shown that leverages the ray casting technique.",David F. Wiley;Henry R. Childs;Bernd Hamann;Kenneth I. Joy,
EuroVis,2004,Interactive High Quality Trimmed NURBS Visualization Using Appearance Preserving Tessellation,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/211-220,"Trimmed NURBS models are the standard representation used in CAD/CAM systems and accurate visualization of large trimmed NURBS models at interactive frame rates is of great interest for industry. To visualize the quality of a surface several techniques like isophotes, reflection lines, etc. are used. Most existing approaches transform the NURBS surfaces into a fine polygonal representation and build static levels of detail from this representation. This polygonal approximation together with its normals are adjusted in a semi-automatic procedure to achieve the desired visual fidelity during visualization. Since this approach allows only for a fixed maximum accuracy and does not support deformable models, another more recent approach is to keep the NURBS representation and generate view-dependent LODs on the fly up to the currently required preciseness.
 However, so far this approach took only into account the geometric error of an approximation and thus neglected the various illumination artifacts introduced by the chosen (possibly view-dependent) triangulation. Although this problem can be solved by using normal maps, the resolution of the normal maps again limits the accuracy. Furthermore, the normal map generation requires a preprocessing step which prevents the support of deformable NURBS models. In this paper we present a novel automatic tessellation algorithm that considers the illumination artifacts and is well suited both for the generation of static and dynamic LOD schemes with guaranteed visual fidelity. Our new method is also capable of high quality visualization of further attributes like curvature, temperature, etc. on surfaces with little or no modification.",Michael Guthe;Ákos Balázs;Reinhard Klein,

It is important to present data in a way that allows the user a high level understanding of the overall organization and structure without losing the ability to study low level detail as needed. Although hierarchically clustered data is already organized, many current means of presenting such data give the user little more than an overview of the organization. It would be useful to see more information about the data even at a high level and to examine specific clusters as needed. We want to understand the relationships of the clusters in terms of the underlying data, and to understand the extent and variability of the data without requiring examination of each data item. To meet these goals, we present an aesthetically appealing visualization based on botanical trees which preserves the natural order of hierarchically organized data. Hierarchical data is rendered as a simple branched tree. The tree gives an overview of the relationships among various clusters and is supplemented with two glyphs which allow the user to focus in on specific clusters of the data at different levels of detail. At a medium level of focus, a cluster glyph based on a radial, space filling approach shows the subtree rooted at a specified cluster. At a low level of detail, the branch glyph allows the viewer to see not only aggregate information about the cluster but the extent and variability of the component clusters.",Eleanor Boyle Chlan;Penny Rheingans,

The classification step is done at the desktop, taking advantage of the 2D mouse as a high accuracy input device. The exploration process takes place on the powerwall.

The raw, highdimensional data is mapped into an abstract 3D distance space using the FastMap algorithm, which helps, together with other linear preprocessing steps, to make changes to the resulting 3D representation within a few seconds. Thus exploration of such datasets is a less tedious task compared to other techniques. We use volumes with four components to enable the user to brush an attribute selection onto the volume for inspection. We exploit multiple transfer functions for displaying these attributes and also to filter one attribute with values of another. An advantage of this volume sampling approach is that the rendering performance is independent of the dataset size. The drawback of limited resolution can be overcome by providing a linked detail view for a freely selectable portion of space. Examples of the inspection and filtering possibilities using a silvicultural dataset illustrate the strengths of our approach.",Guido Reina;Thomas Ertl,

This paper presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented programs using landscape-like distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The familiar landscape methaphor facilitates intuitive navigation and comprehension.

We present a three pass algorithm, which makes efficient use of this feature. Our geo-scientific sub-surface data sets consist typically of a set of high resolution height fields, polygonal objects, and volume slices and lenses. For each height field, we compute a low and high resolution version in a pre-process and divide both into sets of corresponding tiles. For each tile and for the polygonal objects, the first rendering pass computes a z-buffer image using the low resolution tiles, the polygonal objects and the non-transparent volume objects. During the second pass, we render the same objects against the z-buffer of the first pass while submitting an occlusion query with each object. The third pass reads this occlusion information back from the graphics hardware and renders only those high resolution objects, for which the corresponding low resolution objects were not completely occluded. To avoid fill rate bottle necks, the first two passes may be rendered to a low resolution window. Our implementation shows frame rate improvements for all test cases while introducing only a small overhead and no or hardly noticeable errors. Our non-conservative approach does not require front to back sorting and it works for dynamic scenes.",John Plate;Anselm Grundhöfer;Benjamin Schmidt;Bernd Fröhlich 0001,

Multiblock data sets are commonplace in computational mechanics applications. Relatively little research has been performed on contouring multiblock data sets, particularly when the grids overlap one another. Our algorithm proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we determine a continuous interpolant using a set of locally defined radial basis functions (RBFs) in conjunction with a partition of unity method to blend smoothly between these functions. In the second step, we extract isosurface geometry by sampling points on Marching Cubes triangles and projecting these point samples onto the isosurface defined by our interpolant. A surface splatting algorithm is employed for visualizing the resulting point set representing the isosurface. Because of our method's generality, it inherently solves the ""crack problem"" in isosurface generation. Results using a set of synthetic data sets and a discussion of practical considerations are presented. The importance of our method is that it can be applied to arbitrary grid data regardless of mesh layout or orientation.",Christopher S. Co;Serban D. Porumbescu;Kenneth I. Joy,

It allows scientists to focus on regions of interest and track their evolution and interaction over time. To allow the user to freely explore the data set, features must be tracked in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present an efficient time-varying isosurface tracking algorithm. Unlike the previous algorithms which compute the corresponding isosurface components in the adjacent time steps by performing expensive computation at run time, our algorithm can rapidly identify corresponding isosurfaces by performing simple table lookup operations. This table, called the correspondence lookup table, can be computed at a preprocessing stage. The idea behind our approach is that the correspondence relationship can only change at critical isovalues in R3 or R4 and remains unchanged between adjacent pairs of critical isovalues. With our algorithm, isosurfaces can be tracked in an efficient manner with minimal overhead.",Guangfeng Ji;Han-Wei Shen,
EuroVis,2004,Isosurface Computation Made Simple,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym04/293-300,"This paper presents a simple approach for rendering isosurfaces of a scalar field. Using the vertex programming capability of commodity graphics cards, we transfer the cost of computing an isosurface from the Central Processing Unit (CPU), running the main application, to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), rendering the images. We consider a tetrahedral decomposition of the domain and draw one quadrangle (quad) primitive per tetrahedron. A vertex program transforms the quad into the piece of isosurface within the tetrahedron (see Figure 2). In this way, the main application is only devoted to streaming the vertices of the tetrahedra from main memory to the graphics card. For adaptively refined rectilinear grids, the optimization of this streaming process leads to the definition of a new 3D space-filling curve, which generalizes the 2D Sierpinski curve used for efficient rendering of triangulated terrains. We maintain the simplicity of the scheme when constructing view-dependent adaptive refinements of the domain mesh. In particular, we guarantee the absence of T-junctions by satisfying local bounds in our nested error basis. The expensive stage of fixing cracks in the mesh is completely avoided. We discuss practical tradeoffs in the distribution of the workload between the application and the graphics hardware. With current GPU's it is convenient to perform certain computations on the main CPU. Beyond the performance considerations that will change with the new generations of GPU's this approach has the major advantage of avoiding completely the storage in memory of the isosurface vertices and triangles.",Valerio Pascucci,

The error between two time steps is defined as the distance between the data of these time steps. Error tables are used to look up the error between different time steps of a time-varying dataset, especially when run time error computation is expensive. However, even the generation of error tables itself can be expensive. For n time steps, the exact error look-up table (which stores the error values for all pairs of time steps in a matrix) has a memory complexity and pre-processing time complexity of O(n2), and O(1) for error retrieval.Our approximate error look-up table approach uses trees, where the leaf nodes represent original time steps, and interior nodes contain an average (or best-representative) of the children nodes. The error computed on an edge of a tree describes the distance between the two nodes on that edge. Evaluating the error between two different time steps requires traversing a path between the two leaf nodes, and accumulating the errors on the traversed edges. For n time steps, this scheme has a memory complexity and pre-processing time complexity of O(n log(n)), a significant improvement over the exact scheme; the error retrieval complexity is O(log(n)). As we do not need to calculate all possible n2 error terms, our approach is a fast way to generate the approximation.",Christof Nuber;Eric LaMar;Valerio Pascucci;Bernd Hamann;Kenneth I. Joy,

In this paper we propose a new approach to handling high dimensional data, named Visual Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (VHDR), that addresses these drawbacks. VHDR not only generates lower dimensional spaces that are meaningful to users, but also allows user interactions in most steps of the process. In VHDR, dimensions are grouped into a hierarchy, and lower dimensional spaces are constructed using clusters of the hierarchy. We have implemented the VHDR approach into XmdvTool, and extended several traditional multidimensional visualization methods to convey dimension cluster characteristics when visualizing the data set in lower dimensional spaces.

From a path we get exactly one seed per component, which reduces storage and simplifies isosurface extraction. Moreover, the correspondence allows us to extend the contour spectrum of Bajaj et al. to an interface that we call flexible isosurfaces, in which individual contours with different isovalues can be displayed, manipulated and annotated.

The simplification continues until we detect an edge whose collapse would change the topology of the surface. It happens when three edges of the surface form a triangle that does not belong to the surface. The three edges define what we call a seed curve and are used to initialize the search of a constriction.

Interesting isosurface behavior is likely to occur at and around critical isovalues. Current approaches to detect critical isovalues are usually limited to isolated critical points.

Finally, we apply the technique to track critical points in a 2D instationary vector field.",Holger Theisel;Hans-Peter Seidel,

EuroVis,2003,Interaction of Light and Tensor Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym03/157-166,"We present three new ways of looking at tensor volumes. All three methods are based on the interaction of simulated light and the tensor field. Conceptually, rays are shot from a certain direction into the tensor volume. These rays are influenced by the surrounding tensor field and bent as they traverse through the volume. The tensor is visualized by both the nature of the bent rays and by the collection of rays deposited on a receiving plate. The former is similar to streamlines, but shows paths of greatest influence by the tensor field. The latter is similar to caustic effects from photon maps, but shows the convergence or divergence of the rays through the tensor volume. We also use the concept of treating the tensor volume as a special lens that distorts an image. Using backward ray tracing through the tensor volume, we generate image distortions that also show internal properties of the tensor field. A key advantage of these techniques is that they can work directly with non-symmetric tensor fields without first decomposing them into components. Color images can also be found in www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/avis/tensorray.html.",Xiaoqiang Zheng;Alex Pang,

We also devise how to transform the resulting contour line (or surface) into a quartic curve (or surface) based on a curved-triangle (curved-tetrahedron) mapping. A contour in a bivariate quadratic function defined over a triangle in parameter space is a conic section and can be represented by a rational-quadratic function, while in physical space it is a rational quartic. An isosurface in the trivariate case is represented as a rational-quadratic patch in parameter space and a rational-quartic patch in physical space.

The scheme is memory efficient, easy to implement and produces smooth surfaces. It combines adaptive clustering based on quadtrees with piecewise polynomial least squares approximations. The resulting surface components are locally approximated by a smooth B-spline surface obtained by knot removal. Residuals are computed with respect to this surface approximation, determining the clusters that need to be recursively refined, in order to satisfy a prescribed error bound.

Next, we introduce a new detection criterion to extract the centerline voxels from the above skeletons, followed by a thinning, reconnection, and a ranking step. Overall, the proposed method produces centerlines that are object-centered, connected, one voxel thick, robust with respect to object noisiness, handles arbitrary object topologies, comes with a simple pruning threshold, and is fast to compute.

EuroVis,2003,Vector field visualization using Markov Random Field texture synthesis,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym03/195-202,"Vector field visualization aims at generating images in order to convey the information existing in the data. We use Markov Random Field (MRF) texture synthesis methods to generate the visualization from a set of sample textures. MRF texture synthesis methods allow generating images that are locally similar to a given example image. We extend this idea for vector field visualization by identifying each vector value with a representative example image, e.g. a strongly directed texture that is rotated according to a 2D vector. The visualization is synthesized pixel by pixel, where each pixel is chosen from the sample texture according to the vector values of the local pixel. The visualization locally communicates the vector information as each pixel is chosen from a sample that is representative of the vector. Furthermore it is smooth, as MRF texture synthesis searches for best fitting neighborhoods. This leads to dense and smooth visualizations with the additional freedom to use arbitrary representation textures for any vector value.",Francesca Taponecco;Marc Alexa,

Inflow/outflow matching supports the simultaneous extraction of topologically significant inflow and outflow separatrices in a single pass. An adaptive sampling approach is introduced and used to seed streamlines in a more meaningful and efficient manner. Cell-locking is a new concept that isolates regions of a data set that do not contain separatrices. This concept makes streamline propagation more efficient as streamlines are not propagated through cells that do not influence or contain separatrices.

The number of samples, in turn, depends on the resolution of the final image. Hence, viewing the volume at high magnification will incur heavy computation. In this paper, we explore an approach that limits the number of samples to the resolution of the volume, independent of the magnification factor, using a cheap post-convolution process on the interpolated samples to generate the missing samples. For X-ray, this post-convolution is needed only once, after the volume is fully projected, while in full volume rendering, the post-convolution must be applied before each shading and compositing step. Using this technique, we are able to achieve speedups of two and more, without compromising rendering quality.

We also outline how to utilize the proposed volumetric clipping approach for the display of segmented data sets. Moreover, we increase the rendering quality by implementing efficient over-sampling with the pixel shader of consumer graphics accelerators. We give prove that at least 4-times over-sampling is needed to reconstruct the ray integral with sufficient accuracy even with pre-integration.

When visualization aims at supporting the analysis of such data sets, feature-based approches are very useful to reduce the amount of data which is shown at each instance of time and guide the user to the most interesting areas of the data. When using feature-based visualization, one of the most difficult questions is how to extract or specify the features. This is mostly done (semi-)automatic up to now. Especially when interactive analysis of the data is the main goal of the visualization, tools supporting interactive specification of features are needed.In this paper we present a framework for fiexible and interactive specification of high-dimensional and/or complex features in simulation data. The framework makes use of multiple, linked views from information as well as scienti c visualization and is based on a simple and compact feature definition language (FDL). It allows the definition of one or several features, which can be complex and/or hierarchically described by brushing multiple dimensions (using non-binary and composite brushes). The result of the specification is linked to all views, thereby a focus+context style of visualization in 3D is realized.

We generate a hierarchical multiresolution representation of the isosurface. Segmentation and graph generation algorithms can be performed at various levels of detail. At a coarse level of detail, the algorithm detects the main features of the surface.

A spherical partition scheme is proposed to traverse the data blocks in a layered front-to-back order.

Determining if a dataset satisfies an algorithm's assumptions, or the criteria to be used in an analysis are both non-trivial tasks. The use of a dataset's statistical signatures, local higher order moments (LHOMs), to characterize its salient iso-values was presented in [10]. In this paper we propose a computational algorithm that uses LHOMs for expedient estimation of salient iso-values. As LHOMs are model independent statistical signatures our algorithm does not impose any assumptions on the data. Further, the algorithm has a single criterion for characterization of the salient iso-values, and the search for this criterion is easily automated.

This technique, based on the well known ray casting algorithm, performs iso-surfacing and supports interactive threshold adjustment. It is accelerated by the reduction of average ray path lengths to only a few steps per pixel. The volume is divided into cubic sub volumes. Each sub volume that is intersected by an iso-surface is projected to the image plane. A local ray casting step within the sub volume is performed for each pixel covered by the projection. Cell-based first-hit ray casting is perfectly suited whenever fast perspective iso-surfacing is required. This paper describes the basic algorithm, presents possible optimizations and evaluates the performance of the algorithm for one specific application, the post-implantation assessment of endovascular stent placement.

The impressive speed of near double-digit framerates for moderately sized datasets, however, does come at the price of reduced image quality and memory consumption. In this paper, we present the implementation and impact of certain measures that seek to address these shortcomings. Specifically, we investigate the effects of: (i) post-interpolated classification and shading, (ii) matched volume sampling on zoom, (iii) the interpolation of intermediate slices to reduce inter-slice aliasing, and (iv) the re-use of encoded RLE runs for more than one major viewing direction to preserve memory.

The basic idea is to minimize a three-component global error function penalizing the density and gradient errors and the curvature of the unknown filtered function. The optimization problem leads to a large linear equation system defined by a sparse coefficient matrix. We will show that such an equation system can be efficiently solved in frequency domain using fast Fourier transformation (FFT).

We will show that the 3D version can be efficiently used for elimination of the typical staircase artifacts of direct volume rendering without losing fine details. Unlike local filtering techniques, our novel approach ensures a⋅global smoothing effect.

EuroVis,2002,Viewpoint Entropy: A New Tool for Obtaining Good Views of Molecules,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/183-188,"The computation of good viewpoints is important in several fields: computer graphics, removal of degeneracies in computational geometry, robotics, graph drawing, etc. However, in areas such as computer graphics there is no consensus on what a good viewpoint means and, consequently, each author uses his or her own definition according to the requirements of the application. In this paper we present a formal measure strongly based on Information Theory, viewpoint entropy, that can be applied to certain problems of Computer Graphics such as automatic exploration of objects or scenes and Scene Understanding. We also define a new measure, the orthogonal frustum entropy, in order to fulfill the requirements needed to visualize molecules. We design an algorithm that makes use of graphics hardware to accelerate computation, and whose complexity depends mainly on the number of views we want to analyze. Computation of good views of molecules is useful for molecular scientists, a field which includes practitioners from Crystallography, Chemistry, and Biology.",Pere-Pau Vázquez;Miquel Feixas;Mateu Sbert;Antoni Llobet,
EuroVis,2002,Volume Rendering Multivariate Data to Visualize Meteorological Simulations: A Case Study,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/189-194,"High resolution computational weather models are becoming increasing complex. However, the analysis of these models has not benefited from recent advancements in volume visualization. This case study applies the ideas and techniques from multi-dimensional transfer function based volume rendering to the multivariate weather simulations. The specific goal of identifying frontal zones is addressed. By combining temperature and humidity as a multivariate field, the frontal zones are more readily identified thereby assisting the meteorologists in their analysis tasks.",Joe Kniss;Charles D.

EuroVis,2002,Speech and Gesture Multimodal Control of a Whole Earth 3D Visualization Environment,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/195-200,"A growing body of research shows several advantages to multimodal interfaces including increased expressiveness, flexibility, and user freedom. This paper investigates the design of such an interface that integrates speech and hand gestures. The interface has the additional property of operating relative to the user and can be used while the user is in motion or standing at a distance from the computer display. The paper then describes an implementation of the multimodal interface for a whole Earth 3D visualization which presents navigation interface challenges due to the large magnitude of scale and extended spaces that are available. The characteristics of the multimodal interface are examined, such as speed, recognizability of gestures, ease and accuracy of use, and learnability under likely conditions of use. This implementation shows that such a multimodal interface can be effective in a real environment and sets some parameters for the design and use of such interfaces.",David M.

EuroVis,2002,Visualization of Large Web Access Data Sets,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/201-204,"Many real-world e-service applications require analyzing large volumes of transaction data to extract web access information. This paper describes Web Access Visualization (WAV) a system that visually associates the affinities and relationships of clients and URLs for large volumes of web transaction data. To date, many practical research projects have shown the usefulness of a physics-based mass-spring technique to layout data items with close relationships onto a graph. The WAV system: (1) maps transaction data items (clients, URLs) and their relationships to vertices, edges, and positions on a 3D spherical surface; (2) encapsulates a physics-based engine in a visual data analysis platform; and (3) employs various content sensitive visual techniques - linked multiple views, layered drill-down, and fade in/out - for interactive data analysis. We have applied this system to a web application to analyze web access patterns and trends. The web service quality has been greatly benefited from using the information provided by WAV.",Ming C.

EuroVis,2002,Useful Properties of Semantic Depth of Field for Better F+C Visualization,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/205-210,"This paper presents the results of a thorough user study that was performed to assess some features and the general usefulness of Semantic Depth of Field (SDOF). Based on these results, concrete hints are given on how SDOF can be used for visualization. SDOF was found to be a very effective means for guiding the viewer's attention and for giving him or her a quick overview of a data set. It can also very quickly be perceived, and therefore provides an efficient visual channel.Semantic Depth of Field is a focus+context (F+C) technique that uses blur to point the user to the most relevant objects. It was inspired by the depth of field (DOF) effect in photography, which serves a very similar purpose.",Robert Kosara;Silvia Miksch;Helwig Hauser,
EuroVis,2002,An Evaluation of Information Visualization in Attention-Limited Environments,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/211-216,"People often need to quickly access or maintain awareness of secondary information while busy with other primary tasks. Information visualizations provide rapid, effective access to information, but are generally designed to be examined by users as the primary focus of their attention. The goal of this research is to discover how to design information visualizations intended for the periphery and to understand how quickly and effectively people can interpret information visualizations while they are busily performing other tasks. We evaluated how several factors of a visualization (visual density, presence time, and secondary task type) impact people's abilities to continue with a primary task and to complete secondary tasks related to the visualization. Our results suggest that, with relaxed time pressure, reduced visual information density and a single well-defined secondary task, people can effectively interpret visualizations with minimal distraction to their primary task.",Jacob P.

EuroVis,2002,A Novel Approach To Vortex Core Region Detection,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/217-225,"In this paper we present a simple and efficient vortex core region detection algorithm based on ideas derived from combinatorial topology. These ideas originated from Sperner's lemma, which by itself is of little value to detecting vortex cores. However, we take these ideas from the lemma and apply them in a point-based fashion to detecting vortex core regions. The resulting algorithms for both 2D and 3D are quite simple and very efficient compared to existing ones. We applied our algorithms to both numerically simulated and procedurally generated datasets to illustrate the efficacy of our approach.",Ming Jiang 0005;Raghu Machiraju;David S. Thompson,
EuroVis,2002,Locating Closed Streamlines in 3D Vector Fields,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/227-232,The analysis and visualization of flows is a central problem in visualization. Topology based methods have gained increasing interest in recent years. This article describes a method for the detection of closed streamlines in 3D flows. It is based on a special treatment of cases where a streamline reenters a cell to prevent infinite cycling during streamline calculation. The algorithm checks for possible exits of a loop of crossed faces and detects structurally stable closed streamlines. These global features are not detected by conventional topology and feature detection algorithms.,Thomas Wischgoll;Gerik Scheuermann,
EuroVis,2002,Vortex Tracking in Scale-Space,10.2312/VisSym/VisSym02/233-240,"Scale-space techniques have become popular in computer vision for their capability to access the multiscale information inherently contained in images. We show that the field of flow visualization can benefit from these techniques, too, yielding more coherent features and sorting out numerical artifacts as well as irrelevant large-scale features. We describe an implementation of scale-space computation using finite elements and show that performance is sufficient for computing a scale-space of time-dependent CFD data. Feature tracking, if available, allows to process the information provided by scale-space not just visually but also algorithmically. We present a technique for extending a class of feature extraction schemes by an additional dimension, resulting in an efficient solution of the tracking problem.",Dirk Bauer;Ronald Peikert,

Although several RE tools exist, we found their architecture hard to adapt to the domain and problem specific requirements posed by our current practice in Nokia. In this paper, we present an open architecture which allows easy prototyping of RE data exploration and visualization scenarios for a large range of domain models.

We augment the Fast Marching Method (FMM) widely used in level set applications by computing the paramterized boundary location every pixel came from during the boundary evolution. The resulting parameter field is then thresholded to produce the skeleton branches created by boundary features of a given size. The presented algorithm is straightforward to implement, has low memory costs and short execution times, and is robust with respect to the used threshold and initial shape noisiness. The produced skeletons are very similar to the ones delivered by more complex algorithms. Various 2D and 3D applications are presented.",Alexandru C. Telea;Jarke J. van Wijk,
