CHI,2023,VRGit: A Version Control System for Collaborative Content Creation in Virtual Reality,10.1145/3544548.3581136,"Immersive authoring tools allow users to intuitively create and manipulate 3D scenes while immersed in Virtual Reality (VR). Collaboratively designing these scenes is a creative process that involves numerous edits, explorations of design alternatives, and frequent communication with collaborators. Version Control Systems (VCSs) help users achieve this by keeping track of the version history and creating a shared hub for communication. However, most VCSs are unsuitable for managing the version history of VR content because their underlying line differencing mechanism is designed for text and lacks the semantic information of 3D content; and the widely adopted commit model is designed for asynchronous collaboration rather than real-time awareness and communication in VR. We introduce VRGit, a new collaborative VCS that visualizes version history as a directed graph composed of 3D miniatures, and enables users to easily navigate versions, create branches, as well as preview and reuse versions directly in VR. Beyond individual uses, VRGit also facilitates synchronous collaboration in VR by providing awareness of users’ activities and version history through portals and shared history visualizations. In a lab study with 14 participants (seven groups), we demonstrate that VRGit enables users to easily manage version history both individually and collaboratively in VR.",Lei Zhang;Ashutosh Agrawal;Steve Oney;Anhong Guo,,,
CHI,2023,Collaborating Across Realities: Analytical Lenses for Understanding Dyadic Collaboration in Transitional Interfaces,10.1145/3544548.3580879,"Transitional Interfaces are a yet underexplored, emerging class of cross-reality user interfaces that enable users to freely move along the reality-virtuality continuum during collaboration. To analyze and understand how such collaboration unfolds, we propose four analytical lenses derived from an exploratory study of transitional collaboration with 15 dyads. While solving a complex spatial optimization task, participants could freely switch between three contexts, each with different displays (desktop screens, tablet-based augmented reality, head-mounted virtual reality), input techniques (mouse, touch, handheld controllers), and visual representations (monoscopic and allocentric 2D/3D maps, stereoscopic egocentric views). Using the rich qualitative and quantitative data from our study, we evaluated participants’ perceptions of transitional collaboration and identified commonalities and differences between dyads. We then derived four lenses including metrics and visualizations to analyze key aspects of transitional collaboration: (1) place and distance, (2) temporal patterns, (3) group use of contexts, (4) individual use of contexts.",Jan-Henrik Schröder;Daniel Schacht;Niklas Peper;Anita Marie Hamurculu;Hans-Christian Jetter,BP,,
CHI,2023,Collaboration with Conversational AI Assistants for UX Evaluation: Questions and How to Ask them (Voice vs. Text),10.1145/3544548.3581247,"AI is promising in assisting UX evaluators with analyzing usability tests, but its judgments are typically presented as non-interactive visualizations. Evaluators may have questions about test recordings, but have no way of asking them. Interactive conversational assistants provide a Q&A dynamic that may improve analysis efficiency and evaluator autonomy. To understand the full range of analysis-related questions, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz design probe study with 20 participants who interacted with simulated AI assistants via text or voice. We found that participants asked for five categories of information: user actions, user mental model, help from the AI assistant, product and task information, and user demographics. Those who used the text assistant asked more questions, but the question lengths were similar. The text assistant was perceived as significantly more efficient, but both were rated equally in satisfaction and trust. We also provide design considerations for future conversational AI assistants for UX evaluation.",Emily Kuang;Ehsan Jahangirzadeh Soure;Mingming Fan 0001;Jian Zhao 0010;Kristen Shinohara,,,
CHI,2023,Rapsai: Accelerating Machine Learning Prototyping of Multimedia Applications through Visual Programming,10.1145/3544548.3581338,"In recent years, there has been a proliferation of multimedia applications that leverage machine learning (ML) for interactive experiences. Prototyping ML-based applications is, however, still challenging, given complex workflows that are not ideal for design and experimentation. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with seven ML practitioners to gather insights about common ML evaluation workflows. The study helped us derive six design goals, which informed Rapsai1, a visual programming platform for rapid and iterative development of end-to-end ML-based multimedia applications. Rapsai features a node-graph editor to facilitate interactive characterization and visualization of ML model performance. Rapsai streamlines end-to-end prototyping with interactive data augmentation and model comparison capabilities in its no-coding environment. Our evaluation of Rapsai in four real-world case studies (N=15) suggests that practitioners can accelerate their workflow, make more informed decisions, analyze strengths and weaknesses, and holistically evaluate model behavior with real-world input.",Ruofei Du;Na Li;Jing Jin;Michelle Carney;Scott Miles;Maria Kleiner;Xiuxiu Yuan;Yinda Zhang 0001;Anuva Kulkarni;Xingyu Liu;Ahmed Sabie;Sergio Orts-Escolano;Abhishek Kar;Ping Yu;Ram Iyengar;Adarsh Kowdle;Alex Olwal,HM,,
CHI,2023,Charagraph: Interactive Generation of Charts for Realtime Annotation of Data-Rich Paragraphs,10.1145/3544548.3581091,"Documents often have paragraphs packed with numbers that are difficult to extract, compare, and interpret. To help readers make sense of data in text, we introduce the concept of Charagraphs: dynamically generated interactive charts and annotations for in-situ visualization, comparison, and manipulation of numeric data included within text. Three Charagraph characteristics are defined: leveraging related textual information about data; integrating textual and graphical representations; and interacting at different contexts. We contribute a document viewer to select in-text data; generate and customize Charagraphs; merge and refine a Charagraph using other in-text data; and identify, filter, compare, and sort data synchronized between text and visualization. Results of a study show participants can easily create Charagraphs for diverse examples of data-rich text, and when answering questions about data in text, participants were more correct compared to only reading text.",Damien Masson;Sylvain Malacria;Géry Casiez;Daniel Vogel 0001,,,
CHI,2023,ChartDetective: Easy and Accurate Interactive Data Extraction from Complex Vector Charts,10.1145/3544548.3581113,"Extracting underlying data from rasterized charts is tedious and inaccurate; values might be partially occluded or hard to distinguish, and the quality of the image limits the precision of the data being recovered. To address these issues, we introduce a semi-automatic system leveraging vector charts to extract the underlying data easily and accurately. The system is designed to make the most of vector information by relying on a drag-and-drop interface combined with selection, filtering, and previsualization features. A user study showed that participants spent less than 4 minutes to accurately recover data from charts published at CHI with diverse styles, thousands of data points, a combination of different encodings, and elements partially or completely occluded. Compared to other approaches relying on raster images, our tool successfully recovered all data, even when hidden, with a 78% lower relative error.",Damien Masson;Sylvain Malacria;Daniel Vogel 0001;Edward Lank;Géry Casiez,BP,,
CHI,2023,How Instructional Data Physicalisation Fosters Reflection in Personal Informatics,10.1145/3544548.3581198,"The ever-increasing number of devices quantifying our lives offers a perspective of high awareness of one’s wellbeing, yet it remains a challenge for personal informatics (PI) to effectively support data-based reflection. Effective reflection is recognised as a key factor for PI technologies to foster wellbeing. Here, we investigate whether building tangible representations of health data can offer engaging and reflective experiences. We conducted a between-subjects study where n = 60 participants explored their immediate blood pressure data in relation to medical norms. They either used a standard mobile app, built a data representation from LEGO® bricks based on instructions, or completed a free-form brick build. We found that building with instructions fostered more comparison and using bricks fostered focused attention. The free-form condition required extra time to complete, and lacked usability. Our work shows that designing instructional physicalisation experiences for PI is a means of improving engagement and understanding of personal data.",Marit Bentvelzen;Julia Dominiak;Jasmin Niess;Frederique Henraat;Pawel W.

CHI,2023,Speech-Augmented Cone-of-Vision for Exploratory Data Analysis,10.1145/3544548.3581283,"Mutual awareness of visual attention is crucial for successful collaboration. Previous research has explored various ways to represent visual attention, such as field-of-view visualizations and cursor visualizations based on eye-tracking, but these methods have limitations. Verbal communication is often utilized as a complementary strategy to overcome such disadvantages. This paper proposes a novel method that combines verbal communication with the Cone of Vision to improve gaze inference and mutual awareness in VR. We conducted a within-group study with pairs of participants who performed a collaborative analysis of data visualizations in VR. We found that our proposed method provides a better approximation of eye gaze than the approximation provided by head direction. Furthermore, we release the first collaborative head, eyes, and verbal behaviour dataset. The results of this study provide a foundation for investigating the potential of verbal communication as a tool for enhancing visual cues for joint attention.",Riccardo Bovo;Daniele Giunchi;Ludwig Sidenmark;Joshua Newn;Hans Gellersen;Enrico Costanza;Thomas Heinis,,,
CHI,2023,"Communicating Consequences: Visual Narratives, Abstraction, and Polysemy in Rural Bangladesh",10.1145/3544548.3581149,"Information communication and visualization practices reflect two centuries of developments of conventions and best practices which may not be reflective of global audiences’ methods for conveying information. Contrasting between rural traditional visual culture and contemporary HCI and data-visualization, we argue that an understanding of traditional practices for information visualization is required for building rich data-narratives and making data-driven systems more accessible and culturally situated. Our ten-month ethnographic study investigates how rural Bangladeshi communities construct narratives through visual media. 1 Our observation, interviews, and FGDs (n=54) expose how participants convey risk management, decision-making, and monetary management practices to their peers. We find that villagers used a rich network of polysemic symbols and abstractions to manifest subjectivity, factuality, consequence, situatedness, and uncertainty; varied visual attributes for constructing narratives; and emphasized material relations among components in visuals. These findings inform the design of future systems for decision support in a culturally situated manner.",Sharifa Sultana;Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed;Jeffrey M. Rzeszotarski,,,
CHI,2023,GeoCamera: Telling Stories in Geographic Visualizations with Camera Movements,10.1145/3544548.3581470,"In geographic data videos, camera movements are frequently used and combined to present information from multiple perspectives. However, creating and editing camera movements requires significant time and professional skills. This work aims to lower the barrier of crafting diverse camera movements for geographic data videos. First, we analyze a corpus of 66 geographic data videos and derive a design space of camera movements with a dimension for geospatial targets and one for narrative purposes. Based on the design space, we propose a set of adaptive camera shots and further develop an interactive tool called GeoCamera. This interactive tool allows users to flexibly design camera movements for geographic visualizations. We verify the expressiveness of our tool through case studies and evaluate its usability with a user study. The participants find that the tool facilitates the design of camera movements.",Wenchao Li 0005;Zhan Wang;Yun Wang 0012;Di Weng;Liwenhan Xie;Siming Chen 0001;Haidong Zhang;Huamin Qu,,,
CHI,2023,NetworkNarratives: Data Tours for Visual Network Exploration and Analysis,10.1145/3544548.3581452,"This paper introduces semi-automatic data tours to aid the exploration of complex networks. Exploring networks requires significant effort and expertise and can be time-consuming and challenging. Distinct from guidance and recommender systems for visual analytics, we provide a set of goal-oriented tours for network overview, ego-network analysis, community exploration, and other tasks. Based on interviews with five network analysts, we developed a user interface (NetworkNarratives) and 10 example tours. The interface allows analysts to navigate an interactive slideshow featuring facts about the network using visualizations and textual annotations. On each slide, an analyst can freely explore the network and specify nodes, links, or subgraphs as seed elements for follow-up tours. Two studies, comprising eight expert and 14 novice analysts, show that data tours reduce exploration effort, support learning about network exploration, and can aid the dissemination of analysis results. NetworkNarratives is available online, together with detailed illustrations for each tour.",Wenchao Li 0005;Sarah Schöttler;James Scott-Brown;Yun Wang 0012;Siming Chen 0001;Huamin Qu;Benjamin Bach,,,
CHI,2023,Notable: On-the-fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,10.1145/3544548.3580965,"Computational notebooks are widely used for data analysis. Their interleaved displays of code and execution results (e.g., visualizations) are welcomed since they enable iterative analysis and preserve the exploration process. However, the communication of data findings remains challenging in computational notebooks. Users have to carefully identify useful findings from useless ones, document them with texts and visual embellishments, and then organize them in different tools. Such workflow greatly increases their workload, according to our interviews with practitioners. To address the challenge, we designed Notable to offer on-the-fly assistance for data storytelling in computational notebooks. It provides intelligent support to minimize the work of documenting and organizing data findings and diminishes the cost of switching between data exploration and storytelling. To evaluate Notable, we conducted a user study with 12 data workers. The feedback from user study participants verifies its effectiveness and usability.",Haotian Li 0001;Lu Ying;Haidong Zhang;Yingcai Wu;Huamin Qu;Yun Wang 0012,,,
CHI,2023,When do data visualizations persuade? The impact of prior attitudes on learning about correlations from scatterplot visualizations,10.1145/3544548.3581330,"Data visualizations are vital to scientific communication on critical issues such as public health, climate change, and socioeconomic policy. They are often designed not just to inform, but to persuade people to make consequential decisions (e.g., to get vaccinated). Are such visualizations persuasive, especially when audiences have beliefs and attitudes that the data contradict? In this paper we examine the impact of existing attitudes (e.g., positive or negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination) on changes in beliefs about statistical correlations when viewing scatterplot visualizations with different representations of statistical uncertainty. We find that strong prior attitudes are associated with smaller belief changes when presented with data that contradicts existing views, and that visual uncertainty representations may amplify this effect. Finally, even when participants’ beliefs about correlations shifted their attitudes remained unchanged, highlighting the need for further research on whether data visualizations can drive longer-term changes in views and behavior.",Douglas Markant;Milad Rogha;Alireza Karduni;Ryan Wesslen;Wenwen Dou,,,
CHI,2023,Here and Now: Creating Improvisational Dance Movements with a Mixed Reality Mirror,10.1145/3544548.3580666,"This paper explores using mixed reality (MR) mirrors for supporting improvisational dance making. Motivated by the prevalence of mirrors in dance studios and inspired by Forsythe’s Improvisation Technologies, we conducted workshops with 13 dancers and choreographers to inform the design of future MR visualisation and annotation tools for dance. The workshops involved using a prototype MR mirror as a technology probe that reveals the spatial and temporal relationships between the reflected dancing body and its surroundings during improvisation; speed dating group interviews around future design ideas; follow-up surveys and extended interviews with a digital media dance artist and a dance educator. Our findings highlight how the MR mirror enriches dancers’ temporal and spatial perception, creates multi-layered presence, and affords appropriation by dancers. We also discuss the unique place of MR mirrors in the theoretical context of dance and in the history of movement visualisation, and distil lessons for broader HCI research.",Qiushi Zhou;Louise Grebel;Andrew Irlitti;Julie Ann Minaai;Jorge Gonçalves 0001;Eduardo Velloso,,,
CHI,2023,ConceptEVA: Concept-Based Interactive Exploration and Customization of Document Summaries,10.1145/3544548.3581260,"With the most advanced natural language processing and artificial intelligence approaches, effective summarization of long and multi-topic documents—such as academic papers—for readers from different domains still remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce ConceptEVA, a mixed-initiative approach to generate, evaluate, and customize summaries for long and multi-topic documents. ConceptEVA incorporates a custom multi-task longformer encoder decoder to summarize longer documents. Interactive visualizations of document concepts as a network reflecting both semantic relatedness and co-occurrence help users focus on concepts of interest. The user can select these concepts and automatically update the summary to emphasize them. We present two iterations of ConceptEVA evaluated through an expert review and a within-subjects study. We find that participants’ satisfaction with customized summaries through ConceptEVA is higher than their own manually-generated summary, while incorporating critique into the summaries proved challenging. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for designing summarization systems incorporating mixed-initiative interactions.",Xiaoyu Zhang;Jianping Kelvin Li;Po-Wei Chi;Senthil K.

CHI,2023,NFTDisk: Visual Detection of Wash Trading in NFT Markets,10.1145/3544548.3581466,"With the growing popularity of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), a new type of digital assets, various fraudulent activities have appeared in NFT markets. Among them, wash trading has become one of the most common frauds in NFT markets, which attempts to mislead investors by creating fake trading volumes. Due to the sophisticated patterns of wash trading, only a subset of them can be detected by automatic algorithms, and manual inspection is usually required. We propose NFTDisk, a novel visualization for investors to identify wash trading activities in NFT markets, where two linked visualization modules are presented: a radial visualization module with a disk metaphor to overview NFT transactions and a flow-based visualization module to reveal detailed NFT flows at multiple levels. We conduct two case studies and an in-depth user interview with 14 NFT investors to evaluate NFTDisk. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in exploring wash trading activities in NFT markets.",Xiaolin Wen;Yong Wang 0021;Xuanwu Yue;Feida Zhu 0001;Min Zhu,,,
CHI,2023,"UndoPort: Exploring the Influence of Undo-Actions for Locomotion in Virtual Reality on the Efficiency, Spatial Understanding and User Experience",10.1145/3544548.3581557,"When we get lost in Virtual Reality (VR) or want to return to a previous location, we use the same methods of locomotion for the way back as for the way forward. This is time-consuming and requires additional physical orientation changes, increasing the risk of getting tangled in the headsets’ cables. In this paper, we propose the use of undo actions to revert locomotion steps in VR. We explore eight different variations of undo actions as extensions of point&teleport, based on the possibility to undo position and orientation changes together with two different visualizations of the undo step (discrete and continuous). We contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 24 participants investigating the efficiency and orientation of the undo techniques in a radial maze task. We found that the combination of position and orientation undo together with a discrete visualization resulted in the highest efficiency without increasing orientation errors.",Florian Müller 0003;Arantxa Ye;Dominik Schön;Julian Rasch,,,
CHI,2023,AeroRigUI: Actuated TUIs for Spatial Interaction using Rigging Swarm Robots on Ceilings in Everyday Space,10.1145/3544548.3581437,"We present AeroRigUI, an actuated tangible UI for 3D spatial embodied interaction. Using strings controlled by self-propelled swarm robots with a reeling mechanism on ceiling surfaces, our approach enables rigging (control through strings) physical objects’ position and orientation in the air. This can be applied to novel interactions in 3D space, including dynamic physical affordances, 3D information displays, and haptics. Utilizing the ceiling, an often underused room area, AeroRigUI can be applied for a range of applications such as room organization, data physicalization, and animated expressions. We demonstrate the applications based on our proof-of-concept prototype, which includes the hardware design of the rigging robots, named RigBots, and the software design for mid-air object control via interactive string manipulation. We also introduce technical evaluation and analysis of our approach prototype to address the hardware feasibility and safety. Overall, AeroRigUI enables a novel spatial and tangible UI system with great controllability and deployability.",Lilith Yu;Chenfeng Gao;David Wu;Ken Nakagaki,,,
CHI,2023,Polagons: Designing and Fabricating Polarized Light Mosaics with User-Defined Color-Changing Behaviors,10.1145/3544548.3580639,"Polarized light mosaics (PLMs) are color-changing structures that alter their appearance based on the orientation of incident polarized light. While a few artists have developed techniques for crafting PLMs by hand, the underlying material properties are difficult to reason about; there exist no tools to bridge the high-level design objectives with the low-level physics knowledge needed to create PLMs. In this paper, we introduce the first system for creating Polagons: machine-made PLMs crafted from cellophane with user-defined color changing behaviors. Our system includes an interface for designing and visualizing Polagons as well as a fabrication process based on laser cutting and welding that requires minimal assembly by the user. We define the design space for Polagons and demonstrate how formalizing the process for creating PLMs can enable new applications in fields such as education, data visualization, and fashion.",Ticha Sethapakdi;Laura Huang;Vivian Hsinyueh Chan;Lung-Pan Cheng;Fernando Fuzinatto Dall'Agnol;Mackenzie Leake;Stefanie Mueller 0001,,,
CHI,2023,"Computational Notebooks as Co-Design Tools: Engaging Young Adults Living with Diabetes, Family Carers, and Clinicians with Machine Learning Models",10.1145/3544548.3581424,"Engaging end user groups with machine learning (ML) models can help align the design of predictive systems with people's needs and expectations. We present a co-design study investigating the benefits and challenges of using computational notebooks to inform ML models with end user groups. We used a computational notebook to engage young adults, carers, and clinicians with an example ML model that predicted health risk in diabetes care. Through co-design workshops and retrospective interviews, we found that participants particularly valued using the interactive data visualisations of the computational notebook to scaffold multidisciplinary learning, anticipate benefits and harms of the example ML model, and create fictional feature importance plots to highlight care needs. Participants also reported challenges, from running code cells to managing information asymmetries and power imbalances. We discuss the potential of leveraging computational notebooks as interactive co-design tools to meet end user needs early in ML model lifecycles.",Amid Ayobi;Jacob Hughes;Christopher J.

CHI,2023,DataLev: Mid-air Data Physicalisation Using Acoustic Levitation,10.1145/3544548.3581016,"Data physicalisation is a technique that encodes data through the geometric and material properties of an artefact, allowing users to engage with data in a more immersive and multi-sensory way. However, current methods of data physicalisation are limited in terms of their reconfigurability and the types of materials that can be used. Acoustophoresis—a method of suspending and manipulating materials using sound waves—offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we present DataLev, a design space and platform for creating reconfigurable, multimodal data physicalisations with enriched materiality using acoustophoresis. We demonstrate the capabilities of DataLev through eight examples and evaluate its performance in terms of reconfigurability and materiality. Our work offers a new approach to data physicalisation, enabling designers to create more dynamic, engaging, and expressive artefacts.",Lei Gao;Pourang Irani;Sriram Subramanian;Gowdham Prabhakar;Diego Martínez Plasencia;Ryuji Hirayama,,,
CHI,2023,This Watchface Fits with my Tattoos: Investigating Customisation Needs and Preferences in Personal Tracking,10.1145/3544548.3580955,"People engage in self-tracking with diverse data collection and visualisation needs and preferences. Customisable self-tracking tools offer the potential to support individualized preferences by letting people make changes to the aesthetics and functionality of tracker displays. In this paper, we use the customisation options offered by the displays of commercial fitness smartwatches as a lens to investigate when, why and how 386 self-trackers engage in customisations in their daily lives. We find that people largely customise their trackers’ display frequently, multiple times a day, or not at all, with frequent customisations reflecting situational data, aesthetic and personal meaning needs. We discuss implications for the design of tracking tools aiming to support customisation and discuss the utility of customisations towards goal scaffolding and maintaining interest in tracking.",Rúben Gouveia 0001;Daniel A.

CHI,2023,AI Shall Have No Dominion: on How to Measure Technology Dominance in AI-supported Human decision-making,10.1145/3544548.3581095,"In this article, we propose a conceptual and methodological framework for measuring the impact of the introduction of AI systems in decision settings, based on the concept of technological dominance, i.e. the influence that an AI system can exert on human judgment and decisions. We distinguish between a negative component of dominance (automation bias) and a positive one (algorithm appreciation) by focusing on and systematizing the patterns of interaction between human judgment and AI support, or reliance patterns, and their associated cognitive effects. We then define statistical approaches for measuring these dimensions of dominance, as well as corresponding qualitative visualizations. By reporting about four medical case studies, we illustrate how the proposed methods can be used to inform assessments of dominance and of related cognitive biases in real-world settings. Our study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the effects of introducing AI support into naturalistic and collaborative decision-making.",Federico Cabitza;Andrea Campagner;Riccardo Angius;Chiara Natali;Carlo Reverberi,,,
CHI,2023,AutoVis: Enabling Mixed-Immersive Analysis of Automotive User Interface Interaction Studies,10.1145/3544548.3580760,"Automotive user interface (AUI) evaluation becomes increasingly complex due to novel interaction modalities, driving automation, heterogeneous data, and dynamic environmental contexts. Immersive analytics may enable efficient explorations of the resulting multilayered interplay between humans, vehicles, and the environment. However, no such tool exists for the automotive domain. With AutoVis, we address this gap by combining a non-immersive desktop with a virtual reality view enabling mixed-immersive analysis of AUIs. We identify design requirements based on an analysis of AUI research and domain expert interviews (N=5). AutoVis supports analyzing passenger behavior, physiology, spatial interaction, and events in a replicated study environment using avatars, trajectories, and heatmaps. We apply context portals and driving-path events as automotive-specific visualizations. To validate AutoVis against real-world analysis tasks, we implemented a prototype, conducted heuristic walkthroughs using authentic data from a case study and public datasets, and leveraged a real vehicle in the analysis process.",Pascal Jansen;Julian Britten;Alexander Häusele;Thilo Segschneider;Mark Colley;Enrico Rukzio,,,
CHI,2023,DataDancing: An Exploration of the Design Space For Visualisation View Management for 3D Surfaces and Spaces,10.1145/3544548.3580827,"Recent studies have explored how users of immersive visualisation systems arrange data representations in the space around them. Generally, these have focused on placement centred at eye-level in absolute room coordinates. However, work in HCI exploring full-body interaction has identified zones relative to the user’s body with different roles. We encapsulate the possibilities for visualisation view management into a design space (called “DataDancing”). From this design space we extrapolate a variety of view management prototypes, each demonstrating a different combination of interaction techniques and space use. The prototypes are enabled by a full-body tracking system including novel devices for torso and foot interaction. We explore four of these prototypes, encompassing standard wall and table-style interaction as well as novel foot interaction, in depth through a qualitative user study. Learning from the results, we improve the interaction techniques and propose two hybrid interfaces that demonstrate interaction possibilities of the design space.",Jiazhou Liu;Barrett Ens;Arnaud Prouzeau;Jim Smiley;Isobel Kara Nixon;Sarah Goodwin;Tim Dwyer,,,
CHI,2023,GestureExplorer: Immersive Visualisation and Exploration of Gesture Data,10.1145/3544548.3580678,"This paper presents the design and evaluation of GestureExplorer, an Immersive Analytics tool that supports the interactive exploration, classification and sensemaking with large sets of 3D temporal gesture data. GestureExplorer features 3D skeletal and trajectory visualisations of gestures combined with abstract visualisations of clustered sets of gestures. By leveraging the large immersive space afforded by a Virtual Reality interface our tool allows free navigation and control of viewing perspective for users to gain a better understanding of gestures. We explored a selection of classification methods to provide an overview of the dataset that was linked to a detailed view of the data that showed different visualisation modalities. We evaluated GestureExplorer with two user studies and collected feedback from participants with diverse visualisation and analytics backgrounds. Our results demonstrated the promising capability of GestureExplorer for providing a useful and engaging experience in exploring and analysing gesture data.",Ang Li 0007;Jiazhou Liu;Maxime Cordeil;Jack Topliss;Thammathip Piumsomboon;Barrett Ens,,,
CHI,2023,Pearl: Physical Environment based Augmented Reality Lenses for In-Situ Human Movement Analysis,10.1145/3544548.3580715,"This paper presents Pearl, a mixed-reality approach for the analysis of human movement data in situ. As the physical environment shapes human motion and behavior, the analysis of such motion can benefit from the direct inclusion of the environment in the analytical process. We present methods for exploring movement data in relation to surrounding regions of interest, such as objects, furniture, and architectural elements. We introduce concepts for selecting and filtering data through direct interaction with the environment, and a suite of visualizations for revealing aggregated and emergent spatial and temporal relations. More sophisticated analysis is supported through complex queries comprising multiple regions of interest. To illustrate the potential of Pearl, we developed an Augmented Reality-based prototype and conducted expert review sessions and scenario walkthroughs in a simulated exhibition. Our contribution lays the foundation for leveraging the physical environment in the in-situ analysis of movement data.",Weizhou Luo;Zhongyuan Yu;Rufat Rzayev;Marc Satkowski;Stefan Gumhold;Matthew McGinity;Raimund Dachselt,,,
CHI,2023,ProxSituated Visualization: An Extended Model of Situated Visualization using Proxies for Physical Referents,10.1145/3544548.3580952,"Existing situated visualization models assume the user is able to directly interact with the objects and spaces to which the data refers (known as physical referents). We review a growing body of work exploring scenarios where the user interacts with a proxy representation of the physical referent rather than immediately with the object itself. This introduces a complex mixture of immediate situatedness and proxies of situatedness that goes beyond the expressiveness of current models. We propose an extended model of situated visualization that encompasses Immediate Situated Visualization and ProxSituated (Proxy of Situated) Visualization. Our model describes a set of key entities involved in proxSituated scenarios and important relationships between them. From this model, we derive design dimensions and apply them to existing situated visualization work. The resulting design space allows us to describe and evaluate existing scenarios, as well as to creatively generate new conceptual scenarios.",Kadek Ananta Satriadi;Andrew Cunningham;Ross T.

CHI,2023,Through Their Eyes and In Their Shoes: Providing Group Awareness During Collaboration Across Virtual Reality and Desktop Platforms,10.1145/3544548.3581093,"Many collaborative data analysis situations benefit from collaborators utilizing different platforms. However, maintaining group awareness between team members using diverging devices is difficult, not least because common ground diminishes. A person using head-mounted VR cannot physically see a user on a desktop computer even while co-located, and the desktop user cannot easily relate to the VR user’s 3D workspace. To address this, we propose the “eyes-and-shoes” principles for group awareness and abstract them into four levels of techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate these principles with a qualitative user study of 6 participant pairs synchronously collaborating across distributed desktop and VR head-mounted devices. In this study, we vary the group awareness techniques between participants and explore two visualization contexts within participants. The results of this study indicate that the more visual metaphors and views of participants diverge, the greater the level of group awareness is needed. A copy of this paper, the study preregistration, and all supplemental materials required to reproduce the study are available on OSF (link).",David Saffo;Andrea Batch;Cody Dunne;Niklas Elmqvist,,,
CHI,2023,Zeno: An Interactive Framework for Behavioral Evaluation of Machine Learning,10.1145/3544548.3581268,"Machine learning models with high accuracy on test data can still produce systematic failures, such as harmful biases and safety issues, when deployed in the real world. To detect and mitigate such failures, practitioners run behavioral evaluation of their models, checking model outputs for specific types of inputs. Behavioral evaluation is important but challenging, requiring that practitioners discover real-world patterns and validate systematic failures. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with ML practitioners to better understand the challenges of behavioral evaluation and found that it is a collaborative, use-case-first process that is not adequately supported by existing task- and domain-specific tools. Using these findings, we designed zeno, a general-purpose framework for visualizing and testing AI systems across diverse use cases. In four case studies with participants using zeno on real-world models, we found that practitioners were able to reproduce previous manual analyses and discover new systematic failures.",Ángel Alexander Cabrera;Erica Fu;Donald Bertucci;Kenneth Holstein;Ameet Talwalkar;Jason I.

CHI,2023,On the Design of AI-powered Code Assistants for Notebooks,10.1145/3544548.3580940,"AI-powered code assistants, such as Copilot, are quickly becoming a ubiquitous component of contemporary coding contexts. Among these environments, computational notebooks, such as Jupyter, are of particular interest as they provide rich interface affordances that interleave code and output in a manner that allows for both exploratory and presentational work. Despite their popularity, little is known about the appropriate design of code assistants in notebooks. We investigate the potential of code assistants in computational notebooks by creating a design space (reified from a survey of extant tools) and through an interview-design study (with 15 practicing data scientists). Through this work, we identify challenges and opportunities for future systems in this space, such as the value of disambiguation for tasks like data visualization, the potential of tightly scoped domain-specific tools (like linters), and the importance of polite assistants.",Andrew M.

CHI,2023,Tutor In-sight: Guiding and Visualizing Students' Attention with Mixed Reality Avatar Presentation Tools,10.1145/3544548.3581069,"Remote conferencing systems are increasingly used to supplement or even replace in-person teaching. However, prevailing conferencing systems restrict the teacher’s representation to a webcam live-stream, hamper the teacher’s use of body-language, and result in students’ decreased sense of co-presence and participation. While Virtual Reality (VR) systems may increase student engagement, the teacher may not have the time or expertise to conduct the lecture in VR. To address this issue and bridge the requirements between students and teachers, we have developed Tutor In-sight, a Mixed Reality (MR) avatar augmented into the student’s workspace based on four design requirements derived from the existing literature, namely: integrated virtual with physical space, improved teacher’s co-presence through avatar, direct attention with auto-generated body language, and usable workflow for teachers. Two user studies were conducted from the perspectives of students and teachers to determine the advantages of Tutor In-sight in comparison to two existing conferencing systems, Zoom (video-based) and Mozilla Hubs (VR-based). The participants of both studies favoured Tutor In-sight. Among others, this main finding indicates that Tutor In-sight satisfied the needs of both teachers and students. In addition, the participants’ feedback was used to empirically determine the four main teacher requirements and the four main student requirements in order to improve the future design of MR educational tools.",Santawat Thanyadit;Matthias Heintz 0001;Effie L.-C.

CHI,2023,Causalvis: Visualizations for Causal Inference,10.1145/3544548.3581236,"Causal inference is a statistical paradigm for quantifying causal effects using observational data. It is a complex process, requiring multiple steps, iterations, and collaborations with domain experts. Analysts often rely on visualizations to evaluate the accuracy of each step. However, existing visualization toolkits are not designed to support the entire causal inference process within computational environments familiar to analysts. In this paper, we address this gap with Causalvis, a Python visualization package for causal inference. Working closely with causal inference experts, we adopted an iterative design process to develop four interactive visualization modules to support causal inference analysis tasks. The modules are then presented back to the experts for feedback and evaluation. We found that Causalvis effectively supported the iterative causal inference process. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing visualizations for causal inference, particularly for tasks of communication and collaboration.",Grace Guo;Ehud Karavani;Alex Endert;Bum Chul Kwon,,,

It is a powerful tool for data analysis and information retrieval tasks involve asking questions about graphs. In formative study, we found that questions for graphs are not only about the relationship of nodes but also about the properties of graph elements. We propose a pipeline to answer natural language questions about graph visualizations and generate visual answers. We first extract the data from graphs and convert them into GML format. We design data structures to encode graph information and convert them into an knowledge base. We then extract topic entities from questions. We feed questions, entities and knowledge bases into our question-answer model to obtain the SPARQL queries for textual answers. Finally, we design a module to present the answers visually. A user study demonstrates that these visual and textual answers are useful, credible and and transparent.",Sicheng Song;Juntong Chen;Chenhui Li;Changbo Wang,,,
CHI,2023,Visual Belief Elicitation Reduces the Incidence of False Discovery,10.1145/3544548.3580808,"Visualization supports exploratory data analysis (EDA), but EDA frequently presents spurious charts, which can mislead people into drawing unwarranted conclusions. We investigate interventions to prevent false discovery from visualized data. We evaluate whether eliciting analyst beliefs helps guard against the over-interpretation of noisy visualizations. In two experiments, we exposed participants to both spurious and ‘true’ scatterplots, and assessed their ability to infer data-generating models that underlie those samples. Participants who underwent prior belief elicitation made 21% more correct inferences along with 12% fewer false discoveries. This benefit was observed across a variety of sample characteristics, suggesting broad utility to the intervention. However, additional interventions to highlight counterevidence and sample uncertainty did not provide significant advantage. Our findings suggest that lightweight, belief-driven interactions can yield a reliable, if moderate, reduction in false discovery. This work also suggests future directions to improve visual inference and reduce bias.",Ratanond Koonchanok;Gauri Yatindra Tawde;Gokul Ragunandhan Narayanasamy;Shalmali Walimbe;Khairi Reda,HM,,

Our work examines the cognitive load elicited when solving Bayesian problems using icon arrays, text, and a juxtaposition of text and icon arrays. We used a three-pronged approach to capture a nuanced picture of cognitive demand and measure differences in working memory capacity, performance under divided attention using a dual-task paradigm, and subjective ratings of self-reported effort. We found that individuals with low working memory capacity made fewer errors and experienced less subjective workload when the problem contained an icon array compared to text alone, showing that visualization improves accuracy while exerting less cognitive demand. We believe these findings can considerably impact accessible risk communication, especially for individuals with low working memory capacity.",Melanie Bancilhon;Amanda Wright;Sunwoo Ha;R.

CHI,2023,FlowAR: How Different Augmented Reality Visualizations of Online Fitness Videos Support Flow for At-Home Yoga Exercises,10.1145/3544548.3580897,"Online fitness video tutorials are an increasingly popular way to stay fit at home without a personal trainer. However, to keep the screen playing the video in view, users typically disrupt their balance and break the motion flow — two main pillars for the correct execution of yoga poses. While past research partially addressed this problem, these approaches supported only a limited view of the instructor and simple movements. To enable the fluid execution of complex full-body yoga exercises, we propose FlowAR, an augmented reality system for home workouts that shows training video tutorials as always-present virtual static and dynamic overlays around the user. We tested different overlay layouts in a study with 16 participants, using motion capture equipment for baseline performance. Then, we iterated the prototype and tested it in a furnished lab simulating home settings with 12 users. Our results highlight the advantages of different visualizations and the system’s general applicability.",Hye-Young Jo;Laurenz Seidel;Michel Pahud;Mike Sinclair;Andrea Bianchi,,,

VizProg represents students’ statuses as a 2D Euclidean spatial map that encodes the students’ problem-solving approaches and progress in real-time. VizProg allows instructors to navigate the temporal and structural evolution of students’ code, understand relationships between code, and determine when to provide feedback. A comparison experiment showed that VizProg helped to identify more students’ problems than a baseline system. VizProg also provides richer and more comprehensive information for identifying important student behavior.

We describe a study exploring interactions and preferences among co-located individuals using a dynamic data-physicalization in the form of a shape-changing bar chart, and compare this to previous work with single participants. Results suggest that co-located interactions with physical data prompt non-interactive hand gestures, a mirroring of physicalizations, and novel hand gestures in comparison to single participant studies. We also note that behavioural similarities in participants between interactive tabletop studies and data-physicalizations may be capitalised upon for further development of these dynamic representations.

Though many algorithms have been proposed to detect OOD data from text corpora, there is still a lack of interactive tool support for ML developers. In this work, we propose DeepLens, an interactive system that helps users detect and explore OOD issues in massive text corpora. Users can efficiently explore different OOD types in DeepLens with the help of a text clustering method. Users can also dig into a specific text by inspecting salient words highlighted through neuron activation analysis.

We systematically develop an assessment for this ability by: (1) developing a precise definition of misleaders (decisions made in the construction of visualizations that can lead to conclusions not supported by the data), (2) constructing initial test items using a design space of misleaders and chart types, (3) trying out the provisional test on 497 participants, and (4) analyzing the test tryout results and refining the items using Item Response Theory, qualitative analysis, a wrong-due-to-misleader score, and the content validity index. Our final bank of 45 items shows high reliability, and we provide item bank usage recommendations for future tests and different use cases.

CHI,2023,Misleading Beyond Visual Tricks: How People Actually Lie with Charts,10.1145/3544548.3580910,"Data visualizations can empower an audience to make informed decisions. At the same time, deceptive representations of data can lead to inaccurate interpretations while still providing an illusion of data-driven insights. Existing research on misleading visualizations primarily focuses on examples of charts and techniques previously reported to be deceptive. These approaches do not necessarily describe how charts mislead the general population in practice. We instead present an analysis of data visualizations found in a real-world discourse of a significant global event—Twitter posts with visualizations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, violations of visualization design guidelines are not the dominant way people mislead with charts. Specifically, they do not disproportionately lead to reasoning errors in posters’ arguments. Through a series of examples, we present common reasoning errors and discuss how even faithfully plotted data visualizations can be used to support misinformation.",Maxim Lisnic;Cole Polychronis;Alexander Lex;Marina Kogan,,,
CHI,2023,Who Do We Mean When We Talk About Visualization Novices?,10.1145/3544548.3581524,"As more people rely on visualization to inform their personal and collective decisions, researchers have focused on a broader range of audiences, including “novices.” But successfully applying, interrogating, or advancing visualization research for novices demands a clear understanding of what “novice” means in theory and practice. Misinterpreting who a “novice” is could lead to misapplying guidelines and overgeneralizing results. In this paper, we investigated how visualization researchers define novices and how they evaluate visualizations intended for novices. We analyzed 79 visualization papers that used “novice,” “non-expert,” “laypeople,” or “general public” in their titles or abstracts. We found ambiguity within papers and disagreement between papers regarding what defines a novice. Furthermore, we found a mismatch between the broad language describing novices and the narrow population representing them in evaluations (i.e., young people, students, and US residents). We suggest directions for inclusively supporting novices in both theory and practice.",Alyxander Burns;Christiana Lee;Ria Chawla;Evan Peck;Narges Mahyar,BP,,

We observe two significant limitations in translating graphical perception knowledge into actionable visualization recommendation rules/constraints: inconsistent reporting of findings and a lack of shared data across studies. How can we translate the graphical perception literature into a knowledge base for visualization recommendation? We present a review of 59 papers that study user perception and performance across ten visual analysis tasks. Through this study, we contribute a JSON dataset that collates existing theoretical and experimental knowledge and summarizes key study outcomes in graphical perception. We illustrate how this dataset can inform automated encoding decisions with three representative visualization recommendation systems. Based on our findings, we highlight open challenges and opportunities for the community in collating graphical perception knowledge for a range of visualization recommendation scenarios.",Zehua Zeng;Leilani Battle,,,
CHI,2023,Graphical Perception of Saliency-based Model Explanations,10.1145/3544548.3581320,"In recent years, considerable work has been devoted to explaining predictive, deep learning-based models, and in turn how to evaluate explanations. An important class of evaluation methods are ones that are human-centered, which typically require the communication of explanations through visualizations. And while visualization plays a critical role in perceiving and understanding model explanations, how visualization design impacts human perception of explanations remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the graphical perception of model explanations, specifically, saliency-based explanations for visual recognition models. We propose an experimental design to investigate how human perception is influenced by visualization design, wherein we study the task of alignment assessment, or whether a saliency map aligns with an object in an image. Our findings show that factors related to visualization design decisions, the type of alignment, and qualities of the saliency map all play important roles in how humans perceive saliency-based visual explanations.",Yayan Zhao;Mingwei Li;Matthew Berger,,,

Three Studies on Correlation Judgments in Scatterplots,10.1145/3544548.3581111,"How deep neural networks can aid visualization perception research is a wide-open question. This paper provides insights from three perspectives—prediction, generalization, and interpretation—via training and analyzing deep convolutional neural networks on human correlation judgments in scatterplots across three studies. The first study assesses the accuracy of twenty-nine neural network architectures in predicting human judgments, finding that a subset of the architectures (e.g., VGG-19) has comparable accuracy to the best-performing regression analyses in prior research. The second study shows that the resulting models from the first study display better generalizability than prior models on two other judgment datasets for different scatterplot designs. The third study interprets visual features learned by a convolutional neural network model, providing insights about how the model makes predictions, and identifies potential features that could be investigated in human correlation perception studies. Together, this paper suggests that deep neural networks can serve as a tool for visualization perception researchers in devising potential empirical study designs and hypothesizing about perpetual judgments.

CHI,2023,Interactive Context-Preserving Color Highlighting for Multiclass Scatterplots,10.1145/3544548.3580734,"Color is one of the main visual channels used for highlighting elements of interest in visualization. However, in multi-class scatterplots, color highlighting often comes at the expense of degraded color discriminability. In this paper, we argue for context-preserving highlighting during the interactive exploration of multi-class scatterplots to achieve desired pop-out effects, while maintaining good perceptual separability among all classes and consistent color mapping schemes under varying points of interest. We do this by first generating two contrastive color mapping schemes with large and small contrasts to the background. Both schemes maintain good perceptual separability among all classes and ensure that when colors from the two palettes are assigned to the same class, they have a high color consistency in color names. We then interactively combine these two schemes to create a dynamic color mapping for highlighting different points of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness through crowd-sourced experiments and case studies.",Kecheng Lu;Khairi Reda;Oliver Deussen;Yunhai Wang,,,
CHI,2023,Showing Flow: Comparing Usability of Chord and Sankey Diagrams,10.1145/3544548.3581119,"Chord and Sankey diagrams are two common techniques for visualizing flows. Chord diagrams use a radial layout with a single circular axis, and Sankey diagrams use a left-to-right layout with two vertical axes. Previous work suggests both strengths and weaknesses of the radial approach, but little is known about the usability and interpretability of these two layout styles for showing flow. We carried out a study where participants answered questions using equivalent Chord and Sankey diagrams. We measured completion time, errors, perceived effort, and preference. Our results show that participants took substantially longer to answer questions with Chord diagrams and made more errors; participants also rated Chord as requiring more effort, and strongly preferred Sankey diagrams. Our study identifies and explains limitations of the popular Chord layout, provides new understanding about radial vs. linear layouts that can help guide visualization designers, and identifies possible design improvements for both visualization types.",Carl Gutwin;Aristides Mairena;Venkat Bandi,,,

Such auditory representations can make data visualization accessible to people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). This paper presents a sonification method for translating common data visualization into a blend of natural sounds. We hypothesize that people’s familiarity with sounds drawn from nature, such as birds singing in a forest, and their ability to listen to these sounds in parallel, will enable BLV users to perceive multiple data points being sonified at the same time. Informed by an extensive literature review and a preliminary study with 5 BLV participants, we designed an accessible data representation tool, Susurrus, that combines our sonification method with other accessibility features, such as keyboard interaction and text-to-speech feedback. Finally, we conducted a user study with 12 BLV participants and report the potential and application of natural sounds for sonification compared to existing sonification tools.",Md.

Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to support visualization interpretation and exploration without overwhelming blind and low vision (BLV) users. To investigate if and how QA systems can help BLV users in working with visualizations, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study with 24 BLV people where participants freely posed queries about four visualizations. We collected 979 queries and mapped them to popular analytic task taxonomies. We found that retrieving value and finding extremum were the most common tasks, participants often made complex queries and used visual references, and the data topic notably influenced the queries.

We interviewed eight Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (dhh) individuals to understand if and how captions’ inexpressiveness impacts them in online meetings with hearing peers. Automatically captioned speech, we found, lacks affective depth, lending it a hard-to-parse ambiguity and general dullness. Interviewees regularly feel excluded, which some understand is an inherent quality of these types of meetings rather than a consequence of current caption text design. Next, we developed three novel captioning models that depicted, beyond words, features from prosody, emotions, and a mix of both. In an empirical study, 16 dhh participants compared these models with conventional captions. The emotion-based model outperformed traditional captions in depicting emotions and emphasis, with only a moderate loss in legibility, suggesting its potential as a more inclusive design for captions.",Caluã de Lacerda Pataca;Matthew Watkins;Roshan L.

With finite time and resources, ML practitioners are forced to prioritize their model debugging and improvement efforts. Through interviews with 13 ML practitioners at Apple, we found that practitioners construct small targeted test sets to estimate an error’s nature, scope, and impact on users. We built on this insight in a case study with machine translation models, and developed Angler, an interactive visual analytics tool to help practitioners prioritize model improvements. In a user study with 7 machine translation experts, we used Angler to understand prioritization practices when the input space is infinite, and obtaining reliable signals of model quality is expensive. Our study revealed that participants could form more interesting and user-focused hypotheses for prioritization by analyzing quantitative summary statistics and qualitatively assessing data by reading sentences.",Samantha Robertson;Zijie J.

To address this issue, we propose Drava, a visual analytics system that supports users in 1) relating the concepts of humans with the semantic dimensions of DRL and identifying mismatches, 2) providing feedback to minimize the mismatches, and 3) obtaining data insights from concept-driven exploration. Drava provides a set of visualizations and interactions based on visual piles to help users understand and refine concepts and conduct concept-driven exploration.

CHI,2023,ESCAPE: Countering Systematic Errors from Machine's Blind Spots via Interactive Visual Analysis,10.1145/3544548.3581373,"Classification models learn to generalize the associations between data samples and their target classes. However, researchers have increasingly observed that machine learning practice easily leads to systematic errors in AI applications, a phenomenon referred to as “AI blindspots.” Such blindspots arise when a model is trained with training samples (e.g., cat/dog classification) where important patterns (e.g., black cats) are missing or periphery/undesirable patterns (e.g., dogs with grass background) are misleading towards a certain class. Even more sophisticated techniques cannot guarantee to capture, reason about, and prevent the spurious associations. In this work, we propose ESCAPE, a visual analytic system that promotes a human-in-the-loop workflow for countering systematic errors. By allowing human users to easily inspect spurious associations, the system facilitates users to spontaneously recognize concepts associated misclassifications and evaluate mitigation strategies that can reduce biased associations. We also propose two statistical approaches, relative concept association to better quantify the associations between a concept and instances, and debias method to mitigate spurious associations. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed ESCAPE system and statistical measures through extensive evaluation including quantitative experiments, usage scenarios, expert interviews, and controlled user experiments.",Yongsu Ahn;Yu-Ru Lin;Panpan Xu;Zeng Dai,,,

In our three crowdsourced experiments, we provided different tool designs to split money between two fictional programs that benefit two distinct communities. Our main finding indicates that individual-framed visualizations and text may be able to curb unfair allocations caused by group-framed designs.

Therefore, we qualitatively analyzed how experienced analysts (N = 6) from TidyTuesday, a social data project, wrangled and visualized data using GoG-based ggplot2 without given tasks in R Markdown. Though participants’ analysis and customization needs could mismatch with GoG component design, their analysis processes aligned with the goal of GoG to expedite visualization iteration. We also found a feedback loop and tight coupling between visualization and data transformation code, explaining both participants’ productivity and their errors.

Rather than the choice of using either a 2D surface or the 3D space for visualising data being a dichotomy, we argue that users should have the freedom to transform visualisations seamlessly between the two as needed. However, the design space for such transformations is large, and practically uncharted. To explore this, we first establish an overview of the different states that a data visualisation can take in MR, followed by how transformations between these states can facilitate common visualisation tasks. We then describe a design space of how these transformations function, in terms of the different stages throughout the transformation, and the user interactions and input parameters that affect it.

It encodes an object’s rotation around and translation along a unique axis. Visualizations of helical axes have helped to make kinematic data tangible. However, the analysis process often remains tedious, especially if complex motions are examined. We identify multiple key challenges: the absence of interactive tools for the computation and handling of helical axes, visual clutter in axis representations, and a lack of contextualization. We solve these issues by providing the first generalized framework for kinematic analysis with helical axes. Axis sets can be computed on-demand, interactively filtered, and explored in multiple coordinated views. We iteratively developed and evaluated the HAExplorer with active biomechanics researchers. Our results show that the techniques we introduce open up the possibility to analyze non-planar, compound, and interdependent motion data.",Pepe Eulzer;Robert Rockenfeller;Kai Lawonn,,,

Using Predictive Visualizations to Reduce Optimism in Duration Estimates,10.1145/3491102.3502010,"Making time estimates, such as how long a given task might take, frequently leads to inaccurate predictions because of an optimistic bias. Previous attempts to alleviate this bias, including decomposing the task into smaller components and listing potential surprises, have not shown any major improvement. This article builds on the premise that these procedures may have failed because they involve compound probabilities and mixture distributions which are difficult to compute in one’s head. We hypothesize that predictive visualizations of such distributions would facilitate the estimation of task durations. We conducted a crowdsourced study in which 145 participants provided different estimates of overall and sub-task durations and we used these to generate predictive visualizations of the resulting mixture distributions. We compared participants’ initial estimates with their updated ones and found compelling evidence that predictive visualizations encourage less optimistic estimates.",Morgane Koval;Yvonne Jansen,HM,,

To investigate how technology can alleviate this challenge, we developed a visualization tool using de-identified location data sensed from campus WiFi and provided it to contact tracers during mock contact tracing calls. While the visualization allowed contact tracers to find and address inconsistencies due to gaps in community member’s memory, it also introduced inconsistencies such as false-positive and false-negative reports due to imperfect data, and information sharing hesitancy. We suggest design implications for technologies that can better highlight and inform contact tracers of potential areas of inconsistencies, and further present discussion on using imperfect data in decision making.",Kaely Hall;Dong Whi Yoo;Wenrui Zhang;Mehrab Bin Morshed;Vedant Das Swain;Gregory D.

CHI,2022,Annotating Line Charts for Addressing Deception,10.1145/3491102.3502138,"Deceptive visualizations are visualizations that, whether intentionally or not, lead the reader to an understanding of the data which varies from the actual data. Examples of deceptive visualizations can be found in every digital platform, and, despite their widespread use in the wild, there have been limited efforts to alert laypersons to common deceptive visualization practices. In this paper, we present a tool for annotating line charts in the wild that reads line chart images and outputs text and visual annotations to assess the line charts for distortions and help guide the reader towards an honest understanding of the chart data. We demonstrate the usefulness of our tool through a series of case studies on real-world charts. Finally, we perform a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the ability of the proposed tool to educate readers about potentially deceptive visualization practices.",Arlen Fan;Yuxin Ma;Michelle Mancenido;Ross Maciejewski,HM,,
CHI,2022,Making Data Tangible: A Cross-disciplinary Design Space for Data Physicalization,10.1145/3491102.3501939,"Designing a data physicalization requires a myriad of different considerations. Despite the cross-disciplinary nature of these considerations, research currently lacks a synthesis across the different communities data physicalization sits upon, including their approaches, theories, and even terminologies. To bridge these communities synergistically, we present a design space that describes and analyzes physicalizations according to three facets: context (end-user considerations), structure (the physical structure of the artifact), and interactions (interactions with both the artifact and data). We construct this design space through a systematic review of 47 physicalizations and analyze the interrelationships of key factors when designing a physicalization. This design space cross-pollinates knowledge from relevant HCI communities, providing a cohesive overview of what designers should consider when creating a data physicalization while suggesting new design possibilities. We analyze the design decisions present in current physicalizations, discuss emerging trends, and identify underlying open challenges.",S.

CHI,2022,Put a Label On It! Approaches for Constructing and Contextualizing Bar Chart Physicalizations,10.1145/3491102.3501952,"Physicalizations represent data through their tangible and material properties. In contrast to screen-based visualizations, there is currently very limited understanding of how to label or annotate physicalizations to support people in interpreting the data encoded by the physicalization. Because of its spatiality, contextualization through labeling or annotation is crucial to communicate data across different orientations. In this paper, we study labeling approaches as part of the overall construction process of bar chart physicalizations. We designed a toolkit of physical tokens and paper data labels and asked 16 participants to construct and contextualize their own data physicalizations. We found that (i) the construction and contextualization of physicalizations is a highly intertwined process, (ii) data labels are integrated with physical constructs in the final design, and (iii) these are both influenced by orientation changes. We contribute with an understanding of the role of data labeling in the creation and contextualization of physicalizations.",Kim Sauvé;Argenis Ramirez Gomez;Steven Houben,,,

However, many of them are not easily accessible for visually impaired people. In this work, we use three-staged mixed methods to understand the current practice of accessible visualization design for visually impaired people. We analyzed 95 visualizations from various venues to inspect how they are made inaccessible. To understand the rationale and context behind the design choices, we also conducted surveys with 144 practitioners in the U.S. and follow-up interviews with ten selected survey participants. Our findings include the difficulties of handling modern complex and interactive visualizations and the lack of accessibility support from visualization tools in addition to personal and organizational factors making it challenging to perform accessible design practices.",Shakila Cherise S.

CHI,2022,"The Pattern is in the Details: An Evaluation of Interaction Techniques for Locating, Searching, and Contextualizing Details in Multivariate Matrix Visualizations",10.1145/3491102.3517673,"Matrix visualizations are widely used to display large-scale network, tabular, set, or sequential data. They typically only encode a single value per cell, e.g., through color. However, this can greatly limit the visualizations’ utility when exploring multivariate data, where each cell represents a data point with multiple values (referred to as details). Three well-established interaction approaches can be applicable in multivariate matrix visualizations (or MMV): focus+context, pan&zoom, and overview+detail. However, there is little empirical knowledge of how these approaches compare in exploring MMV. We report on two studies comparing them for locating, searching, and contextualizing details in MMV. We first compared four focus+context techniques and found that the fisheye lens overall outperformed the others. We then compared the fisheye lens, to pan&zoom and overview+detail. We found that pan&zoom was faster in locating and searching details, and as good as overview+detail in contextualizing details.",Yalong Yang 0001;Wenyu Xia;Fritz Lekschas;Carolina Nobre;Robert Krüger;Hanspeter Pfister,,,
CHI,2022,RoleSeer: Understanding Informal Social Role Changes in MMORPGs via Visual Analytics,10.1145/3491102.3517712,"Massively multiplayer online role-playing games create virtual communities that support heterogeneous “social roles” determined by gameplay interaction behaviors under a specific social context. For all social roles, formal roles are pre-defined, obvious, and explicitly ascribed to the people holding the roles, whereas informal roles are not well-defined and unspoken. Identifying the informal roles and understanding their subtle changes are critical to designing sociability mechanisms. However, it is nontrivial to understand the existence and evolution of such roles due to their loosely defined, interconvertible, and dynamic characteristics. We propose a visual analytics system, RoleSeer, to investigate informal roles from the perspectives of behavioral interactions and depict their dynamic interconversions and transitions. Two cases, experts’ feedback, and a user study suggest that RoleSeer helps interpret the identified informal roles and explore the patterns behind role changes. We see our approach’s potential in investigating informal roles in a broader range of social games.",Laixin Xie;Ziming Wu;Peng Xu;Wei Li 0094;Xiaojuan Ma;Quan Li,,,
CHI,2022,Visualizing Instructions for Physical Training: Exploring Visual Cues to Support Movement Learning from Instructional Videos,10.1145/3491102.3517735,"Instructional videos for physical training have gained popularity in recent years among sport and fitness practitioners, due to the proliferation of affordable and ubiquitous forms of online training. Yet, learning movement this way poses challenges: lack of feedback and personalised instructions, and having to rely on personal imitation capacity to learn movements. We address some of these challenges by exploring visual cues’ potential to help people imitate movements from instructional videos. With a Research through Design approach, focused on strength training, we augmented an instructional video with different sets of visual cues: directional cues, body highlights, and metaphorical visualizations. We tested each set with ten practitioners over three recorded sessions, with follow-up interviews. Through thematic analysis, we derived insights on the effect of each set of cues for supporting movement learning. Finally, we generated design takeaways to inform future HCI work on visual cues for instructional training videos.",Alessandra Semeraro;Laia Turmo Vidal,,,
CHI,2022,graphiti: Sketch-based Graph Analytics for Images and Videos,10.1145/3491102.3501923,"Graph analytics is currently performed using a combination of code, symbolic algebra, and network visualizations. The analyst has to work with symbolic and abstract forms of data to construct and analyze graphs. We locate unique design opportunities at the intersection of computer vision and graph analytics, by utilizing visual variables extracted from images/videos and some direct manipulation and pen interaction techniques. We also summarize commonly used graph operations and graphical representations (graphs, simplicial complexes, hypergraphs), and map them to a few brushes and direct manipulation actions. The mapping enables us to visually construct and analyze a wide range of graphs on top of images, videos, and sketches. The design framework is implemented as a sketch-based notebook interface to demonstrate the design possibilities. User studies with scientists from various fields reveal innovative use cases for such an embodied interaction paradigm for graph analytics.",Nazmus Saquib;Faria Huq;Syed Arefinul Haque,,,
CHI,2022,CrossData: Leveraging Text-Data Connections for Authoring Data Documents,10.1145/3491102.3517485,"Data documents play a central role in recording, presenting, and disseminating data. Despite the proliferation of applications and systems designed to support the analysis, visualization, and communication of data, writing data documents remains a laborious process, requiring a constant back-and-forth between data processing and writing tools. Interviews with eight professionals revealed that their workflows contained numerous tedious, repetitive, and error-prone operations. The key issue that we identified is the lack of persistent connection between text and data. Thus, we developed CrossData, a prototype that treats text-data connections as persistent, interactive, first-class objects. By automatically identifying, establishing, and leveraging text-data connections, CrossData enables rich interactions to assist in the authoring of data documents. An expert evaluation with eight users demonstrated the usefulness of CrossData, showing that it not only reduced the manual effort in writing data documents but also opened new possibilities to bridge the gap between data exploration and writing.",Zhutian Chen;Haijun Xia,,,

While existing tools help data scientists track changes in code, they provide less support for understanding the iterative changes that the code produces in the data. We explore the idea of visualizing differences in datasets as a core feature of exploratory data analysis, a concept we call Diff in the Loop (DITL). We evaluated DITL in a user study with 16 professional data scientists and found it helped them understand the implications of their actions when manipulating data. We summarize these findings and discuss how the approach can be generalized to different data science workflows.",April Yi Wang;Will Epperson;Robert A. DeLine;Steven Mark Drucker,,,

The study is based on 1,710 images sampled from a visualization dataset (VIS30K) over five years. We simulated four CVDs on each image. First, four researchers (one with a CVD) identified existing issues and helpful aspects in a subset of the images. Based on the resulting labels, 200 crowdworkers provided 30,000 ratings on present CVD issues in the simulated images. We analyzed this data for correlations, clusters, trends, and free text comments to gain a first overview of paper figure accessibility. Overall, about 60 % of the images were rated accessible. Furthermore, our study indicates that accessibility issues are subjective and hard to detect.

However, most of this work has studied the analysis process in simulated or isolated environments, leading to a gap in connecting these findings to large-scale business (enterprise) contexts, where visual analysis is most needed to make sense of the large amounts of data being generated. In this work, we conducted digital ”field” observations to understand how users conduct visual analyses in an enterprise setting, where they operate within a large ecosystem of systems and people. From these observations, we identified four common objectives, six recurring visual investigation patterns, and five emergent themes. We also performed a quantitative analysis of logs over 2530 user sessions from a second visual analysis product to validate that our patterns were not product-specific.",Irene Rae;Feng Zhou;Martin Bilsing;Philipp Bunge,,,
CHI,2022,Juvenile Graphical Perception: A Comparison between Children and Adults,10.1145/3491102.3501893,"Data visualization is pervasive in the lives of children as they encounter graphs and charts in early education and online media. In spite of this prevalence, our guidelines and understanding of how children perceive graphs stem primarily from studies conducted with adults. Previous psychology and education research indicates that children’s cognitive abilities are different from adults. Therefore, we conducted a classic graphical perception study on a population of children aged 8–12 enrolled in the Ivy After School Program in Boston, MA and adult computer science students enrolled in Northeastern University to determine how accurately participants judge differences in particular graphical encodings. We record the accuracy of participants’ answers for five encodings most commonly used with quantitative data. The results of our controlled experiment show that children have remarkably similar graphical perception to adults, but are consistently less accurate at interpreting the visual encodings. We found similar effectiveness rankings, relative differences in error between the different encodings, and patterns of bias across encoding types. Based on our findings, we provide design guidelines and recommendations for creating visualizations for children.

CHI,2022,Reflective Spring Cleaning: Using Personal Informatics to Support Infrequent Notification Personalization,10.1145/3491102.3517493,"Distracting mobile notifications are a high-profile problem but previous research suggests notification management tools are underused because of the barriers users face in relation to the perceived benefits. We posit that users might be more motivated to personalize if they could view contextual data for how personalizations would have impacted their recent notifications. We propose the ‘Reflective Spring Cleaning’ approach to support notification management through infrequent personalization with visualization of collected notification data. To simplify and contextualize key trends in a user’s notifications, we framed these visualizations within a novel who-what-when data abstraction. We evaluated it through a four-week longitudinal study: 21 participants logged their notifications before and after a personalization session that included suggestions for notification management contextualized against visualizations of their recent notifications. A debriefing interview described their new experience after two more weeks of logging. Our approach encouraged users to critically reflect on their notifications, which frequently inspired them to personalize and improved the experience of the majority.",Izabelle F.

Our research establishes emoji intensity scales for seven basic emotions: happiness, anger, disgust, sadness, shock, annoyance, and love. In our survey (N = 1195), participants worldwide assigned emotions and intensities to 68 face emojis. According to our results, certain feelings, such as happiness or shock, are visualized by manifold emojis covering a broad spectrum of intensities. Other feelings, such as anger, have limited and only very intense representative visualizations. We further emphasize that the cultural background influences emojis’ perception: for instance, linear-active cultures (e.g., UK, Germany) rate the intensity of such visualizations higher than multi-active (e.g., Brazil, Russia) or reactive cultures (e.g., Indonesia, Singapore). To summarize, our manuscript promotes future research on more expressive, culture-aware emoji design.",Andrey Krekhov;Katharina Emmerich;Johannes Fuchs 0001;Jens Harald Krüger,,,
CHI,2022,Designing Word Filter Tools for Creator-led Comment Moderation,10.1145/3491102.3517505,"Online social platforms centered around content creators often allow comments on content, where creators can then moderate the comments they receive. As creators can face overwhelming numbers of comments, with some of them harassing or hateful, platforms typically provide tools such as word filters for creators to automate aspects of moderation. From needfinding interviews with 19 creators about how they use existing tools, we found that they struggled with writing good filters as well as organizing and revising their filters, due to the difficulty of determining what the filters actually catch. To address these issues, we present FilterBuddy, a system that supports creators in authoring new filters or building from pre-made ones, as well as organizing their filters and visualizing what comments are captured by them over time. We conducted an early-stage evaluation of FilterBuddy with YouTube creators, finding that participants see FilterBuddy not just as a moderation tool, but also a means to organize their comments to better understand their audiences.",Shagun Jhaver;Quan Ze Chen;Detlef Knauss;Amy X.

The design of technologies surrounding open science resources can facilitate such knowledge construction, but this has not been investigated yet. To do so, we first conducted a scoping review of literature, from which we draw design heuristics for knowledge construction in digital environments. Subsequently, we grouped the underlying technological functionalities into three design categories: i) structuring and supporting collaboration, ii) supporting the learning process, and iii) structuring, visualising and navigating (learning) content. Finally, we mapped the design categories and associated design heuristics to core components of popular open science platforms. This mapping constitutes a design space (design implications), which informs researchers and designers in the HCI community about suitable functionalities for supporting knowledge construction in existing or new digital open science platforms.",Leonie Disch;Angela Fessl;Viktoria Pammer-Schindler,,,

We uncover a wide range of gender stereotypes in this corpus via topic modeling, odds ratio and Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). We further conduct a survey to understand people’s perception of gender roles in messages from this corpus and if gender stereotyping is a concern. The results show that people want to be aware of gender roles in the messages, but remain unconcerned unless the perceived gender roles conflict with the recipient’s true personality.

To provide a wide range of matching sensations of being touched or stroked, current approaches typically need large numbers of different physical textures. However, even advanced devices can only accommodate a limited number of textures to remain wearable. Therefore, a better understanding is necessary of how expectations elicited by different visualizations affect haptic perception, to achieve a balance between physical constraints and great variety of matching physical textures. In this work, we conducted an experiment (N=31) assessing how the perception of roughness is affected within VR. We designed a prototype for arm stroking and compared the effects of different visualizations on the perception of physical textures with distinct roughnesses. Additionally, we used the visualizations’ real-world materials, no-haptics and vibrotactile feedback as baselines.

To express such variations of confusion matrices, we design an algebra that models confusion matrices as probability distributions. Based on this algebra, we develop Neo, a visual analytics system that enables practitioners to flexibly author and interact with hierarchical and multi-output confusion matrices, visualize derived metrics, renormalize confusions, and share matrix specifications. Finally, we demonstrate Neo’s utility with three model evaluation scenarios that help people better understand model performance and reveal hidden confusions.",Jochen Görtler;Fred Hohman;Dominik Moritz;Kanit Wongsuphasawat;Donghao Ren;Rahul Nair;Marc Kirchner;Kayur Patel,BP,,

Existing methods mainly focus on the visual appearance of visualizations by regarding them as bitmap images. However, the structural information intrinsically existing in SVG-based visualizations is ignored. Such structural information can delineate the spatial and hierarchical relationship among visual elements, and characterize visualizations thoroughly from a new perspective.

We find that analysts champion simple charts with clear takeaways that are nonetheless connected with existing semantic information or domain hypotheses. We conclude by recommending that visualization recommendation designers explore ways of integrating context and expectation into their systems.",Calvin S. Bao;Siyao Li;Sarah G.

CHI,2022,VisGuide: User-Oriented Recommendations for Data Event Extraction,10.1145/3491102.3517648,"Data exploration systems have become popular tools with which data analysts and others can explore raw data and organize their observations. However, users of such systems who are unfamiliar with their datasets face several challenges when trying to extract data events of interest to them. Those challenges include progressively discovering informative charts, organizing them into a logical order to depict a meaningful fact, and arranging one or more facts to illustrate a data event. To alleviate them, we propose VisGuide—a data exploration system that generates personalized recommendations to aid users’ discovery of data events in breadth and depth by incrementally learning their data exploration preferences and recommending meaningful charts tailored to them. As well as user preferences, VisGuide’s recommendations simultaneously consider sequence organization and chart presentation. We conducted two user studies to evaluate 1) the usability of VisGuide and 2) user satisfaction with its recommendation system. The results of those studies indicate that VisGuide can effectively help users create coherent and user-oriented visualization trees that represent meaningful data events.",Yu-Rong Cao;Xiao-Han Li;Jia-Yu Pan;Wen-Chieh Lin,,,

To better support urban accessibility assessment using data visualizations, we conducted a three-part interview study with 25 participants across five stakeholder groups using map visualization probes. We present a multi-stakeholder analysis of visualization needs and sensemaking processes to explore how interactive visualizations can support stakeholder decision making. In particular, we elaborate how stakeholders’ varying levels of familiarity with accessibility, geospatial analysis, and specific geographic locations influences their sensemaking needs.

We analyze videogames in order to not only inspire the design of better agents, but to stop agent designers from replicating research that has already been theorized, designed, and tested in-depth. We present a qualitative thematic analysis of sight cues in videogames and develop a framework to support human-agent interaction design. The framework identifies the different locations and stimulus types – both visualizations and sonifications – available to designers and the types of information they can convey as sight cues. Insights from several other cue properties are also presented. We close with suggestions for implementing such cues with existing technologies to improve the safety, privacy, and efficiency of human-agent interactions.",Matthew Rueben;Matthew Rodney Horrocks;Jennifer Eleanor Martinez;Michelle V.

While several biosignal representations exist, designing effective visualizations and understanding user perceptions within social VR entertainment remains unclear. We adopt a mixed-methods approach to design biosignals for social VR entertainment. Using survey (N=54), context-mapping (N=6), and co-design (N=6) methods, we derive four visualizations. We then ran a within-subjects study (N=32) in a virtual jazz-bar to investigate how heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) visualizations, and signal rate, influence perceived avatar arousal, user distraction, and preferences. Findings show that skeuomorphic visualizations for both biosignals allow differentiable arousal inference; skeuomorphic and particles were least distracting for HR, whereas all were similarly distracting for BR; biosignal perceptions often depend on avatar relations, entertainment type, and emotion inference of avatars versus spaces. We contribute HR and BR visualizations, and considerations for designing social VR entertainment biosignal visualizations.",Sueyoon Lee;Abdallah El Ali;Maarten W. A. Wijntjes;Pablo César,,,

Visitors choose emotions, locate associated paintings in the museum, experience an emotional story while viewing them, and self-report their response. A subsequent interview with a portrayal of the artist employs computer vision to estimate emotional responses from facial expressions. Visitors are given a souvenir postcard visualizing their emotional data. A study of 132 members of the public (39 interviewed) illuminates key themes: designing emotional provocations; capturing emotional responses; engaging visitors with their data; a tendency for them to align their views with the system's interpretation; and integrating these elements into emotional trajectories.

To address the need for accessible data representations on the web that provide direct, multimodal, and up-to-date access to the data, we investigate audio data narratives –which combine textual descriptions and sonification (the mapping of data to non-speech sounds). We conduct two co-design workshops with screen reader users to define design principles that guide the structure, content, and duration of a data narrative. Based on these principles and relevant auditory processing characteristics, we propose a dynamic programming approach to automatically generate an audio data narrative from a given dataset. We evaluate our approach with 16 screen reader users. Findings show with audio narratives, users gain significantly more insights from the data. Users describe data narratives help them better extract and comprehend the information in both the sonification and description.",Alexa F. Siu;Gene S.-H. Kim;Sile O'Modhrain;Sean Follmer,,,
CHI,2022,Slide-Tone and Tilt-Tone: 1-DOF Haptic Techniques for Conveying Shape Characteristics of Graphs to Blind Users,10.1145/3491102.3517790,"We increasingly rely on up-to-date, data-driven graphs to understand our environments and make informed decisions. However, many of the methods blind and visually impaired users (BVI) rely on to access data-driven information do not convey important shape-characteristics of graphs, are not refreshable, or are prohibitively expensive. To address these limitations, we introduce two refreshable, 1-DOF audio-haptic interfaces based on haptic cues fundamental to object shape perception. Slide-tone uses finger position with sonification, and Tilt-tone uses fingerpad contact inclination with sonification to provide shape feedback to users. Through formative design workshops (n = 3) and controlled evaluations (n = 8), we found that BVI participants appreciated the additional shape information, versatility, and reinforced understanding these interfaces provide; and that task accuracy was comparable to using interactive tactile graphics or sonification alone. Our research offers insight into the benefits, limitations, and considerations for adopting these haptic cues into a data visualization context.",Danyang Fan;Alexa Fay Siu;Wing-Sum Adrienne Law;Raymond Ruihong Zhen;Sile O'Modhrain;Sean Follmer,,,

Building on prior findings about the experiences of screen-reader users with online data visualizations, we present VoxLens, an open-source JavaScript plug-in that—with a single line of code—improves the accessibility of online data visualizations for screen-reader users using a multi-modal approach. Specifically, VoxLens enables screen-reader users to obtain a holistic summary of presented information, play sonified versions of the data, and interact with visualizations in a “drill-down” manner using voice-activated commands. Through task-based experiments with 21 screen-reader users, we show that VoxLens improves the accuracy of information extraction and interaction time by 122% and 36%, respectively, over existing conventional interaction with online data visualizations. Our interviews with screen-reader users suggest that VoxLens is a “game-changer” in making online data visualizations accessible to screen-reader users, saving them time and effort.",Ather Sharif;Olivia H.

A controlled user evaluation with 18 BLV adults found a COVID-19 infosonic enabled a clearer mental image than a traditional sonification. Further, infosonics prove complementary to text descriptions and facilitate independent understanding of the data.

CHI,2022,"FluidMeet: Enabling Frictionless Transitions Between In-Group, Between-Group, and Private Conversations During Virtual Breakout Meetings",10.1145/3491102.3517558,"People often form small conversation groups during physical gatherings to have ad-hoc and informal conversations. As these groups are loosely defined, others can often overhear and join the conversation. However, current video-conferencing tools only allow for strict boundaries between small conversation groups, inhibiting fluid group formations and between-group conversations. This isolates small-group conversations from others and leads to inefficient transitions between conversations. We present FluidMeet, a virtual breakout meeting system that employs flexible conversation boundaries and cross-group conversation visualizations to enable fluid conversation group formations and ad-hoc, informal conversations. FluidMeet enables out-group members to overhear group conversations while allowing conversation groups to control their shared level of context. Users within conversation groups can also quickly switch between in-group and private conversations. A study of FluidMeet showed that it encouraged users to break group boundaries, made them feel less isolated in group conversations, and facilitated communication across different groups.",Erzhen Hu;Md.

When used as a design futuring method, previs can facilitate rapid, iterative discussions that reveal tensions, challenges, and opportunities for new research. We performed eight one-week design futuring sprints, in which individual HCI researchers collaborated with a lead designer to produce concept sketches, storyboards, and videos that examined future applications of their research. From these experiences, we identify recurring themes and challenges and present a One Week Futuring Workbook that other researchers can use to guide their own futuring sprints.

However, information displayed on OHMDs can cause attention shifts, which distract users from natural social interactions. We hypothesize that information displayed in paracentral and near-peripheral vision can be better perceived while the user is maintaining eye contact during face-to-face conversations. Leveraging this idea, we designed a circular progress bar to provide progress updates in paracentral and near-peripheral vision. We compared it with textual and linear progress bars under two conversation settings: a simulated one with a digital conversation partner and a realistic one with a real partner. Results show that a circular progress bar can effectively reduce notification distractions without losing eye contact and is more preferred by users.

CHI,2022,i-LaTeX : Manipulating Transitional Representations between LaTeX Code and Generated Documents,10.1145/3491102.3517494,"Document description languages such as LaTeX are used extensively to author scientific and technical documents, but editing them is cumbersome: code-based editors only provide generic features, while WYSIWYG interfaces only support a subset of the language. Our interviews with 11 LaTeX users highlighted their difficulties dealing with textually-encoded abstractions and with the mappings between source code and document output. To address some of these issues, we introduce Transitional Representations for document description languages, which enable the visualisation and manipulation of fragments of code in relation to their generated output. We present i-LaTeX, a LaTeX editor equipped with Transitional Representations of formulae, tables, images, and grid layouts. A 16-participant experiment shows that Transitional Representations let them complete common editing tasks significantly faster, with fewer compilations, and with a lower workload. We discuss how Transitional Representations affect editing strategies and conclude with directions for future work.",Camille Gobert;Michel Beaudouin-Lafon,,,
CHI,2022,"Classroom Dandelions: Visualising Participant Position, Trajectory and Body Orientation Augments Teachers' Sensemaking",10.1145/3491102.3517736,"Despite the digital revolution, physical space remains the site for teaching and learning embodied knowledge and skills. Both teachers and students must develop spatial competencies to effectively use classroom spaces, enabling fluid verbal and non-verbal interaction. While video permits rich activity capture, it provides no support for quickly seeing activity patterns that can assist learning. In contrast, position tracking systems permit the automated modelling of spatial behaviour, opening new possibilities for feedback. This paper introduces the design rationale for ”Dandelion Diagrams” that integrate participant location, trajectory and body orientation over a variable period. Applied in two authentic teaching contexts (a science laboratory, and a nursing simulation) we show how heatmaps showing only teacher/student location led to misinterpretations that were resolved by overlaying Dandelion Diagrams. Teachers also identified a variety of ways they could aid professional development. We conclude Dandelion Diagrams assisted sensemaking, but discuss the ethical risks of over-interpretation.",Gloria Fernández-Nieto;Pengcheng An;Jian Zhao 0010;Simon Buckingham Shum;Roberto Martínez Maldonado,,,
CHI,2022,GANSlider: How Users Control Generative Models for Images using Multiple Sliders with and without Feedforward Information,10.1145/3491102.3502141,"We investigate how multiple sliders with and without feedforward visualizations influence users’ control of generative models. In an online study (N=138), we collected a dataset of people interacting with a generative adversarial network (StyleGAN2) in an image reconstruction task. We found that more control dimensions (sliders) significantly increase task difficulty and user actions. Visual feedforward partly mitigates this by enabling more goal-directed interaction. However, we found no evidence of faster or more accurate task performance. This indicates a tradeoff between feedforward detail and implied cognitive costs, such as attention. Moreover, we found that visualizations alone are not always sufficient for users to understand individual control dimensions. Our study quantifies fundamental UI design factors and resulting interaction behavior in this context, revealing opportunities for improvement in the UI design for interactive applications of generative models. We close by discussing design directions and further aspects.",Hai Dang;Lukas Mecke;Daniel Buschek,,,

CHI,2022,Cicero: A Declarative Grammar for Responsive Visualization,10.1145/3491102.3517455,"Designing responsive visualizations can be cast as applying transformations to a source view to render it suitable for a different screen size. However, designing responsive visualizations is often tedious as authors must manually apply and reason about candidate transformations. We present Cicero, a declarative grammar for concisely specifying responsive visualization transformations which paves the way for more intelligent responsive visualization authoring tools. Cicero’s flexible specifier syntax allows authors to select visualization elements to transform, independent of the source view’s structure. Cicero encodes a concise set of actions to encode a diverse set of transformations in both desktop-first and mobile-first design processes. Authors can ultimately reuse design-agnostic transformations across different visualizations. To demonstrate the utility of Cicero, we develop a compiler to an extended version of Vega-Lite, and provide principles for our compiler. We further discuss the incorporation of Cicero into responsive visualization authoring tools, such as a design recommender.",Hyeok Kim;Ryan A.

Data Animator leverages the Data Illustrator framework to analyze and match objects between two static visualizations, and generates automated transitions by default. Designers have the flexibility to interpret and adjust the matching results through a visual interface. Data Animator also supports the division of a complex animation into stages through hierarchical keyframes, and uses data attributes to stagger the start time and vary the speed of animating objects through a novel timeline interface.

CHI,2021,Integrated Visualization Editing via Parameterized Declarative Templates,10.1145/3411764.3445356,"Interfaces for creating visualizations typically embrace one of several common forms. Textual specification enables fine-grained control, shelf building facilitates rapid exploration, while chart choosing promotes immediacy and simplicity. Ideally these approaches could be unified to integrate the user- and usage-dependent benefits found in each modality, yet these forms remain distinct. We propose parameterized declarative templates, a simple abstraction mechanism over JSON-based visualization grammars, as a foundation for multimodal visualization editors. We demonstrate how templates can facilitate organization and reuse by factoring the more than 160 charts that constitute Vega-Lite’s example gallery into approximately 40 templates. We exemplify the pliability of abstracting over charting grammars by implementing—as a template—the functionality of the shelf builder Polestar (a simulacra of Tableau) and a set of templates that emulate the Google Sheets chart chooser. We show how templates support multimodal visualization editing by implementing a prototype and evaluating it through an approachability study.",Andrew M. McNutt;Ravi Chugh,,,

We introduce PredictMe, a tool for belief-driven visual analysis, enabling users to draw and test their beliefs against data, as an alternative to data-driven exploration. PredictMe combines belief elicitation with traditional visualization interactions to support mixed analysis styles. In a comparative study, we investigated how these affordances impact participants’ cognition. Results show that PredictMe prompts participants to incorporate their working knowledge more frequently in queries. Participants were more likely to attend to discrepancies between their mental models and the data. However, those same participants were also less likely to engage in interactions associated with exploration, and ultimately inspected fewer visualizations and made fewer discoveries. The results suggest that belief elicitation may moderate exploratory behaviors, instead nudging users to be more deliberate in their analysis.

Such visualizations lack conceptual overviews incorporating domain-relevant knowledge, needed when examining documents such as research articles or technical reports. To address this shortcoming, we present ConceptScope, a technique that utilizes a domain ontology to represent the conceptual relationships in a document in the form of a Bubble Treemap visualization. Multiple coordinated views of document structure and concept hierarchy with text overviews further aid document analysis. ConceptScope facilitates exploration and comparison of single and multiple documents respectively. We demonstrate ConceptScope by visualizing research articles and transcripts of technical presentations in computer science.

In such systems, performance is often influenced by different analysis strategies that statistical analysis methods cannot account for. To remedy this lack of nuance, we propose a novel analysis methodology for evaluating complex interactive visualizations at scale. We implement our analysis methods in reVISit, which enables analysts to explore participant interaction performance metrics and responses in the context of users’ analysis strategies. Replays of participant sessions can aid in identifying usability problems during pilot studies and make individual analysis processes salient. To demonstrate the applicability of reVISit to visualization studies, we analyze participant data from two published crowdsourced studies.

CHI,2021,IGScript: An Interaction Grammar for Scientific Data Presentation,10.1145/3411764.3445535,"Most of the existing scientific visualizations toward interpretive grammar aim to enhance customizability in either the computation stage or the rendering stage or both, while few approaches focus on the data presentation stage. Besides, most of these approaches leverage the existing components from the general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) instead of developing a standalone compiler, which pose a great challenge about learning curves for the domain experts who have limited knowledge about programming. In this paper, we propose IGScript, a novel script-based interaction grammar tool, to help build scientific data presentation animations for communication. We design a dual-space interface and a compiler which converts natural language-like grammar statements or scripts into a data story animation to make an interactive customization on script-driven data presentations, and then develop a code generator (decompiler) to translate the interactive data exploration animations back into script codes to achieve statement parameters. IGScript makes the presentation animations editable, e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips. We demonstrate the usability, customizability, and flexibility of IGScript by a user study, four case studies conducted by using four types of commonly-used scientific data, and performance evaluations.",Richen Liu;Min Gao;Shunlong Ye;Jiang Zhang 0002,,,

In addition, existing video navigations are not optimized for instrument learning, making the learning experience encumbered. Guided by our formative interviews with guitar players and prior literature, we designed Soloist, a mixed-initiative learning framework that automatically generates customizable curriculums from off-the-shelf guitar video lessons. Soloist takes raw videos as input and leverages deep-learning based audio processing to extract musical information. This back-end processing is used to provide an interactive visualization to support effective video navigation and real-time feedback on the user's performance, creating a guided learning experience. We demonstrate the capabilities and specific use-cases of Soloist within the domain of learning electric guitar solos using instructional YouTube videos. A remote user study, conducted to gather feedback from guitar players, shows encouraging results as the users unanimously preferred learning with Soloist over unconverted instructional videos.",Bryan Wang;Mengyu Yang;Tovi Grossman,,,
CHI,2021,Falx: Synthesis-Powered Visualization Authoring,10.1145/3411764.3445249,"Modern visualization tools aim to allow data analysts to easily create exploratory visualizations. When the input data layout conforms to the visualization design, users can easily specify visualizations by mapping data columns to visual channels of the design. However, when there is a mismatch between data layout and the design, users need to spend significant effort on data transformation. We propose Falx, a synthesis-powered visualization tool that allows users to specify visualizations in a similarly simple way but without needing to worry about data layout. In Falx, users specify visualizations using examples of how concrete values in the input are mapped to visual channels, and Falx automatically infers the visualization specification and transforms the data to match the design. In a study with 33 data analysts on four visualization tasks involving data transformation, we found that users can effectively adopt Falx to create visualizations they otherwise cannot implement.",Chenglong Wang;Yu Feng 0001;Rastislav Bodík;Isil Dillig;Alvin Cheung;Amy J.

CHI,2021,Locomotion Vault: the Extra Mile in Analyzing VR Locomotion Techniques,10.1145/3411764.3445319,"Numerous techniques have been proposed for locomotion in virtual reality (VR). Several taxonomies consider a large number of attributes (e.g., hardware, accessibility) to characterize these techniques. However, finding the appropriate locomotion technique (LT) and identifying gaps for future designs in the high-dimensional space of attributes can be quite challenging. To aid analysis and innovation, we devised Locomotion Vault (https://locomotionvault.github.io/), a database and visualization of over 100 LTs from academia and industry. We propose similarity between LTs as a metric to aid navigation and visualization. We show that similarity based on attribute values correlates with expert similarity assessments (a method that does not scale). Our analysis also highlights an inherent trade-off between simulation sickness and accessibility across LTs. As such, Locomotion Vault shows to be a tool that unifies information on LTs and enables their standardization and large-scale comparison to help understand the space of possibilities in VR locomotion.",Massimiliano Di Luca;Hasti Seifi;Simon Egan;Mar González-Franco,,,
CHI,2021,Comparison of Different Types of Augmented Reality Visualizations for Instructions,10.1145/3411764.3445724,"Augmented Reality (AR) is increasingly being used for providing guidance and supporting troubleshooting in industrial settings. While the general application of AR has been shown to provide clear benefits regarding physical tasks, it is important to understand how different visualization types influence user’s performance during the execution of the tasks. Previous studies evaluating AR and user’s performance compared different media types or types of AR hardware as opposed to different types of visualization for the same hardware type. This paper provides details of our comparative study in which we identified the influence of visualization types on the performance of complex machine set-up processes. Although our results show clear advantages to using concrete rather than abstract visualizations, we also find abstract visualizations coupled with videos leads to similar user performance as with concrete visualizations.",Florian Jasche;Sven Hoffmann;Thomas Ludwig 0005;Volker Wulf,,,
CHI,2021,"Effects of Semantic Segmentation Visualization on Trust, Situation Awareness, and Cognitive Load in Highly Automated Vehicles",10.1145/3411764.3445351,"Autonomous vehicles could improve mobility, safety, and inclusion in traffic. While this technology seems within reach, its successful introduction depends on the intended user’s acceptance. A substantial factor for this acceptance is trust in the autonomous vehicle’s capabilities. Visualizing internal information processed by an autonomous vehicle could calibrate this trust by enabling the perception of the vehicle’s detection capabilities (and its failures) while only inducing a low cognitive load. Additionally, the simultaneously raised situation awareness could benefit potential take-overs. We report the results of two comparative online studies on visualizing semantic segmentation information for the human user of autonomous vehicles. Effects on trust, cognitive load, and situation awareness were measured using a simulation (N=32) and state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation on a pre-recorded real-world video (N=41). Results show that the visualization using Augmented Reality increases situation awareness while remaining low cognitive load.",Mark Colley;Benjamin Eder;Jan Ole Rixen;Enrico Rukzio,,,

Consequently, the Computer Science community calls for the involvement of the general public in the design and evaluation of AI systems. Assessing the fairness of individual predictors is an essential step in the development of equitable algorithms. In this study, we evaluate the effect of two common visualisation techniques (text-based and scatterplot) and the display of the outcome information (i.e., ground-truth) on the perceived fairness of predictors. Our results from an online crowdsourcing study (N = 80) show that the chosen visualisation technique significantly alters people’s fairness perception and that the presented scenario, as well as the participant’s gender and past education, influence perceived fairness.

The flexibility of notebooks brings challenges for effective code search, where classic search interfaces for traditional software code may be limited. In this paper, we propose, NBSearch, a novel system that supports semantic code search in notebook collections and interactive visual exploration of search results. NBSearch leverages advanced machine learning models to enable natural language search queries and intuitive visualizations to present complicated intra- and inter-notebook relationships in the returned results. We developed NBSearch through an iterative participatory design process with two experts from a large software company. We evaluated the models with a series of experiments and the whole system with a controlled user study. The results indicate the feasibility of our analytical pipeline and the effectiveness of NBSearch to support code search in large notebook collections.",Xingjun Li;Yuanxin Wang;Hong Wang;Yang Wang;Jian Zhao 0010,,,
CHI,2021,Understanding Trigger-Action Programs Through Novel Visualizations of Program Differences,10.1145/3411764.3445567,"Trigger-action programming (if-this-then-that rules) empowers non-technical users to automate services and smart devices. As a user’s set of trigger-action programs evolves, the user must reason about behavior differences between similar programs, such as between an original program and several modification candidates, to select programs that meet their goals. To facilitate this process, we co-designed user interfaces and underlying algorithms to highlight differences between trigger-action programs. Our novel approaches leverage formal methods to efficiently identify and visualize differences in program outcomes or abstract properties. We also implemented a traditional interface that shows only syntax differences in the rules themselves. In a between-subjects online experiment with 107 participants, the novel interfaces better enabled participants to select trigger-action programs matching intended goals in complex, yet realistic, situations that proved very difficult when using traditional interfaces showing syntax differences.",Valerie Zhao;Lefan Zhang;Bo Wang;Michael L.

Concretely, a Variational Autoencoder embeds gestures recorded as 3D skeletons on an interactive 2D map. GestureMap further integrates three computational capabilities to connect exploration to quantitative measures: Leveraging DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA), we compute average gestures to 1) represent gesture groups at a glance; 2) compute a new consensus measure (variance around average gesture); and 3) cluster gestures with k-means. We evaluate GestureMap and its concepts with eight experts and an in-depth analysis of published data. Our findings show how GestureMap facilitates exploring large datasets and helps researchers to gain a visual understanding of elicited gesture spaces. It further opens new directions, such as comparing elicitations across studies. We discuss implications for elicitation studies and research, and opportunities to extend our approach to additional tasks in gesture elicitation.",Hai Dang;Daniel Buschek,,,

Post-play visualizations are key for such improvements. Despite the increased interest in visualizations of gameplay, research specifically informing the design of player-centric visualizations is currently limited. As with all visualizations, their design should, however, be guided by a thorough understanding of the goals to be achieved and which information is important and why. This paper reports on a mixed-methods study exploring the information demands posed by players on post-play visualizations and the goals they pursue with such visualizations. We focused on three genres that enjoy great popularity within the competitive gaming scene. Our results provide useful guideposts on which data to focus on by offering an overview of the relevance of different in-game metrics across genres.

To conduct the study, an original media server was developed for co-locating remote performers into shared virtual 3D environments which were accessed through popular video conferencing software. The results of this qualitative study indicate that tele-immersive environments uniquely provide performers with a strong sense of co- presence, feelings of physical connection, and an increased ability to enter the social-flow states required for improvisational theatre.

CHI,2021,Quantitative Data Visualisation on Virtual Globes,10.1145/3411764.3445152,"Geographic data visualisation on virtual globes is intuitive and widespread, but has not been thoroughly investigated. We explore two main design factors for quantitative data visualisation on virtual globes: i) commonly used primitives (2D bar, 3D bar, circle) and ii) the orientation of these primitives (tangential, normal, billboarded). We evaluate five distinctive visualisation idioms in a user study with 50 participants. The results show that aligning primitives tangentially on the globe’s surface decreases the accuracy of area-proportional circle visualisations, while the orientation does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of length-proportional bar visualisations. We also find that tangential primitives induce higher perceived mental load than other orientations. Guided by these results we design a novel globe visualisation idiom, Geoburst, that combines a virtual globe and a radial bar chart. A preliminary evaluation reports potential benefits and drawbacks of the Geoburst visualisation.",Kadek Ananta Satriadi;Barrett Ens;Tobias Czauderna;Maxime Cordeil;Bernhard Jenny,,,

In this work, we present initial design considerations for graph physicalisations, as well as an empirical study investigating differences in comprehension between virtual and physical representations. We found that participants perceived themselves as being more accurate via touch and sight (visual-haptic) than the graphical-only modality, and perceived a triangle count task as less difficult in visual-haptic than in the graphical-only modality.

CHI,2021,It's a Wrap: Toroidal Wrapping of Network Visualisations Supports Cluster Understanding Tasks,10.1145/3411764.3445439,"We explore network visualisation on a two-dimensional torus topology that continuously wraps when the viewport is panned. That is, links may be “wrapped” across the boundary, allowing additional spreading of node positions to reduce visual clutter. Recent work has investigated such pannable wrapped visualisations, finding them not worse than unwrapped drawings for small networks for path-following tasks. However, they did not evaluate larger networks nor did they consider whether torus-based layout might also better display high-level network structure like clusters. We offer two algorithms for improving toroidal layout that is completely autonomous and automatic panning of the viewport to minimiswe wrapping links. The resulting layouts afford fewer crossings, less stress, and greater cluster separation. In a study of 32 participants comparing performance in cluster understanding tasks, we find that toroidal visualisation offers significant benefits over standard unwrapped visualisation in terms of improvement in error by 62.7% and time by 32.3%.",Kun-Ting Chen;Tim Dwyer;Benjamin Bach;Kim Marriott,,,

Heads-Up-Displays (HUDs) provide an opportunity to visually inform drivers about vehicle perception and interpretation of the driving environment. One approach to HUD design may be to reveal to drivers the vehicle’s full contextual understanding, though it is not clear if the benefits of additional information outweigh the drawbacks of added complexity, or if this balance holds across drivers. We designed and tested an Augmented Reality (AR) HUD in an online study (N = 298), focusing on the influence of HUD visualizations on drivers’ situation awareness and perceptions. Participants viewed two driving scenes with one of three HUD conditions. Results were nuanced: situation awareness declined with increasing driving context complexity, and contrary to expectation, also declined with the presence of a HUD compared to no HUD. Significant differences were found by varying HUD complexity, which led us to explore different characterizations of complexity, including counts of scene items, item categories, and illuminated pixels. Our analysis finds that driving style interacts with driving context and HUD complexity, warranting further study.",Rebecca Currano;So Yeon Park;Dylan James Moore;Kent Lyons;David Sirkin,,,

We furthermore develop a method that considers head movements when fusing labels. Using physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures, we show that (1) both techniques do not increase users’ workload, sickness, nor break presence (2) our continuous valence and arousal annotations are consistent with discrete within-VR and original stimuli ratings (3) users exhibit high similarity in viewing behavior, where fused ratings perfectly align with intended labels.

We investigated researchers’ transcription and annotation practice, their overall analysis workflow, and the prevalence of direct analysis of audiovisual recordings. We found that a key task was locating and analyzing inspectables, interesting segments in recordings. Since locating inspectables can be time consuming, participants look for detectables, visual or auditory cues that indicate the presence of an inspectable.

In contrast to our expectation, data of our 34 study participants indicate that the background has far less influence on the perception of AR visualizations. Moreover, we observed a mismatch between measured and subjectively reported performance. We discuss the importance of the background and recommendations for visual real-world augmentations. Overall, our results suggest that AR can be used in many visually challenging environments without losing the ability to productively work with the visualizations shown.",Marc Satkowski;Raimund Dachselt,,,

We present FashionQ, an AI-based CST that has three interactive visualization tools (StyleQ, TrendQ, and MergeQ). Through interviews and a user study with 20 fashion design professionals (10 participants for the interviews and 10 for the user study), we demonstrate the effectiveness of FashionQ on facilitating divergent and convergent thinking and identify opportunities and challenges of incorporating AI in the ideation process. Our findings highlight the role and use of AI in each cognitive operation based on professionals’ expertise and suggest future implications of AI-based CST development.",Youngseung Jeon;Seungwan Jin;Patrick C.

CHI,2021,Design and Analysis of Intelligent Text Entry Systems with Function Structure Models and Envelope Analysis,10.1145/3411764.3445566,"Designing intelligent interactive text entry systems often relies on factors that are difficult to estimate or assess using traditional HCI design and evaluation methods. We introduce a complementary approach by adapting function structure models from engineering design. We extend their use by extracting controllable and uncontrollable parameters from function structure models and visualizing their impact using envelope analysis. Function structure models allow designers to understand a system in terms of its functions and flows between functions and decouple functions from function carriers. Envelope analysis allows the designer to further study how parameters affect variables of interest, for example, accuracy, keystroke savings and other dependent variables. We provide examples of function structure models and illustrate a complete envelope analysis by investigating a parameterized function structure model of predictive text entry. We discuss the implications of this design approach for both text entry system design and for critique of system contributions.",Per Ola Kristensson;Thomas Müllners,,,
CHI,2021,Fits and Starts: Enterprise Use of AutoML and the Role of Humans in the Loop,10.1145/3411764.3445775,"AutoML systems can speed up routine data science work and make machine learning available to those without expertise in statistics and computer science. These systems have gained traction in enterprise settings where pools of skilled data workers are limited. In this study, we conduct interviews with 29 individuals from organizations of different sizes to characterize how they currently use, or intend to use, AutoML systems in their data science work. Our investigation also captures how data visualization is used in conjunction with AutoML systems. Our findings identify three usage scenarios for AutoML that resulted in a framework summarizing the level of automation desired by data workers with different levels of expertise. We surfaced the tension between speed and human oversight and found that data visualization can do a poor job balancing the two. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of human-in-the-loop visual analytics approaches.",Anamaria Crisan;Brittany Fiore-Gartland,HM,,
CHI,2021,Vis Ex Machina: An Analysis of Trust in Human versus Algorithmically Generated Visualization Recommendations,10.1145/3411764.3445195,"More visualization systems are simplifying the data analysis process by automatically suggesting relevant visualizations. However, little work has been done to understand if users trust these automated recommendations. In this paper, we present the results of a crowd-sourced study exploring preferences and perceived quality of recommendations that have been positioned as either human-curated or algorithmically generated. We observe that while participants initially prefer human recommenders, their actions suggest an indifference for recommendation source when evaluating visualization recommendations. The relevance of presented information (e.g., the presence of certain data fields) was the most critical factor, followed by a belief in the recommender’s ability to create accurate visualizations. Our findings suggest a general indifference towards the provenance of recommendations, and point to idiosyncratic definitions of visualization quality and trustworthiness that may not be captured by simple measures. We suggest that recommendation systems should be tailored to the information-foraging strategies of specific users.",Rachael Zehrung;Astha Singhal;Michael Correll;Leilani Battle,,,
CHI,2021,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,10.1145/3411764.3445344,"Creating expressive narrative visualization often requires choosing a well-planned narrative order that invites the audience in. The narrative can either follow the linear order of story events (chronology), or deviate from linearity (anachronies). While evidence exists that anachronies in novels and films can enhance story expressiveness, little is known about how they can be incorporated into narrative visualization. To bridge this gap, this work introduces the idea of narrative linearity to visualization and investigates how different narrative orders affect the expressiveness of time-oriented stories. First, we conducted preliminary interviews with seven experts to clarify the motivations and challenges of manipulating narrative linearity in time-oriented stories. Then, we analyzed a corpus of 80 time-oriented stories and identified six most salient patterns of narrative orders. Next, we conducted a crowdsourcing study with 221 participants. Results indicated that anachronies have the potential to make time-oriented stories more expressive without hindering comprehensibility.",Xingyu Lan;Xinyue Xu;Nan Cao,,,

While data videos are increasingly gaining popularity, few systematic reviews or structured analyses exist for their design. In this work, we introduce a design space for animated visual narratives in data videos. The design space combines a dimension for animation techniques that are frequently used to facilitate data communication with one for visual narrative strategies served by such animation techniques to support story presentation. We derived our design space from the analysis of 82 high-quality data videos collected from online sources. We conducted a workshop with 20 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of our design space.

CHI,2021,Understanding Data Accessibility for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,10.1145/3411764.3445743,"Using visualization requires people to read abstract visual imagery, estimate statistics, and retain information. However, people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) often process information differently, which may complicate connecting abstract visual information to real-world quantities. This population has traditionally been excluded from visualization design, and often has limited access to data related to their well being. We explore how visualizations may better serve this population. We identify three visualization design elements that may improve data accessibility: chart type, chart embellishment, and data continuity. We evaluate these elements with populations both with and without IDD, measuring accuracy and efficiency in a web-based online experiment with time series and proportion data. Our study identifies performance patterns and subjective preferences for people with IDD when reading common visualizations. These findings suggest possible solutions that may break the cognitive barriers caused by conventional design guidelines.",Keke Wu;Emma Petersen;Tahmina Ahmad;David Burlinson;Shea Tanis;Danielle Albers Szafir,BP,,

Defying public health officials, coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data visualizations showing that the government’s pandemic response was excessive and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro- and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in public life.",Crystal Lee;Tanya Yang;Gabrielle D.

CHI,2021,Does Interaction Improve Bayesian Reasoning with Visualization?,10.1145/3411764.3445176,"Interaction enables users to navigate large amounts of data effectively, supports cognitive processing, and increases data representation methods. However, there have been few attempts to empirically demonstrate whether adding interaction to a static visualization improves its function beyond popular beliefs. In this paper, we address this gap. We use a classic Bayesian reasoning task as a testbed for evaluating whether allowing users to interact with a static visualization can improve their reasoning. Through two crowdsourced studies, we show that adding interaction to a static Bayesian reasoning visualization does not improve participants’ accuracy on a Bayesian reasoning task. In some cases, it can significantly detract from it. Moreover, we demonstrate that underlying visualization design modulates performance and that people with high versus low spatial ability respond differently to different interaction techniques and underlying base visualizations. Our work suggests that interaction is not as unambiguously good as we often believe; a well designed static visualization can be as, if not more, effective than an interactive one.",Abigail Mosca;Alvitta Ottley;Remco Chang,,,
CHI,2021,Can Anthropographics Promote Prosociality?A Review and Large-Sample Study,10.1145/3411764.3445637,"Visualizations designed to make readers compassionate with the persons whose data is represented have been called anthropographics and are commonly employed by practitioners. Empirical studies have recently examined whether anthropographics indeed promote empathy, compassion, or the likelihood of prosocial behavior, but findings have been inconclusive so far. This work contributes a detailed overview of past experiments, and two new experiments that use large samples and a combination of design strategies to maximize the possibility of finding an effect. We tested an information-rich anthropographic against a simple bar chart, asking participants to allocate hypothetical money in a crowdsourcing study. We found that the anthropographic had, at best, a small effect on money allocation. Such a small effect may be relevant for large-scale donation campaigns, but the large sample sizes required to observe an effect and the noise involved in measuring it make it very difficult to study in more depth.

Motivated by the extensive social exchange around visualizations in online communities, this research examines characteristics and motivations of people’s reactions to posts featuring visualizations. Following a Grounded Theory approach, we study 475 reactions from the /r/dataisbeautiful community, identify ten distinguishable reaction types, and consider their contribution to the discourse. A follow-up survey with 168 Reddit users clarified their intentions to react.

CHI,2021,Interpreting the Effect of Embellishment on Chart Visualizations,10.1145/3411764.3445739,"Infographics range from minimalism that aims to convey the raw data to elaborately decorated, or embellished, graphics that aim to engage readers by telling a story. Several studies have shown evidence to negative, but also positive, effects on embellishments. We conducted a set of experiments to gauge more precisely how embellishments affect how people relate to infographics and make sense of the conveyed story. By analyzing questionnaires, interviews, and eye-tracking data simplified by bundling, we show that, within bounds, embellishments have a positive effect on how users get engaged in understanding an infographic, with very limited downside. To our knowledge, our work is the first that fuses the aforementioned three information sources to understand infographics. Our findings can help to design more fine-grained studies to quantify the effects of embellishments and also to design infographics that effectively use the embellishments’ positive aspects identified. I think the contribution does not appear well in the abstract. It’s not just that the visual embellishments are positive. We show a methodology that allows us to see what these effects are (in addition to engagement, memorization and recall) at several levels (scales, interviews, eye tracking) which are therefore physiological and emotional.

In addition to creating 2D and 3D mechanical structures, LaserFactory creates conductive circuit traces with arbitrary geometries, picks-and-places electronic and electromechanical components, and solders them in place. To enable this functionality, we make four contributions. First, we build a hardware add-on to the laser cutter head that can deposit silver circuit traces and assemble components. Second, we develop a new method to cure dispensed silver using a CO2 laser. Third, we build a motion-based signaling method that allows our system to be readily integrated with commercial laser cutters. Finally, we provide a design and visualization tool for making functional devices with LaserFactory. Having described the LaserFactory system, we demonstrate how it is used to fabricate devices such as a fully functioning quadcopter and a sensor-equipped wristband. Our evaluation shows that LaserFactory can assemble a variety of differently sized components (up to 65g), that these can be connected by narrow traces (down to 0.75mm) that become highly conductive after laser soldering (3.2Ω/m), and that our acceleration-based sensing scheme works reliably (to 99.5% accuracy).",Martin Nisser;Christina Chen Liao;Yuchen Chai;Aradhana Adhikari;Steve Hodges 0001;Stefanie Müller 0001,,,
CHI,2021,Designing CAST: A Computer-Assisted Shadowing Trainer for Self-Regulated Foreign Language Listening Practice,10.1145/3411764.3445190,"Shadowing, i.e., listening to recorded native speech and simultaneously vocalizing the words, is a popular language-learning technique that is known to improve listening skills. However, despite strong evidence for its efficacy as a listening exercise, existing shadowing systems do not adequately support listening-focused practice, especially in self-regulated learning environments with no external feedback. To bridge this gap, we introduce Computer-Assisted Shadowing Trainer (CAST), a shadowing system that makes self-regulation easy and effective through four novel design elements — (i) in-the-moment highlights for tracking and visualizing progress, (ii) contextual blurring for inducing self-reflection on misheard words, (iii) self-listening comparators for post-practice self-evaluation, and (iv) adjustable pause-handles for self-paced practice. We base CAST on a formative user study (N=15) that provides fresh empirical grounds on the needs and challenges of shadowers. We validate our design through a summative evaluation (N=12) that shows learners can successfully self-regulate their shadowing practice with CAST while retaining focus on listening.",Mohi Reza;Dongwook Yoon,,,
CHI,2021,A Visual Analytics Approach to Facilitate the Proctoring of Online Exams,10.1145/3411764.3445294,"Online exams have become widely used to evaluate students’ performance in mastering knowledge in recent years, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19.

This paper presents a novel visual analytics approach to facilitate the proctoring of online exams by analyzing the exam video records and mouse movement data of each student. Specifically, we detect and visualize suspected head and mouse movements of students in three levels of detail, which provides course instructors and teachers with convenient, efficient and reliable proctoring for online exams.

Real images (e.g., paintings, photographs, sketches) act as both inspiration and as a resource of visual elements that can be mapped to data. The creative pipeline involves the semi-guided extraction of relevant elements of an image (arbitrary regions, regular shapes, color palettes, textures) aided by computer vision techniques; the binding of these graphical elements and their features to data in order to create meaningful visualizations; and the iterative refinement of both features and visualizations through direct manipulation.

We also identify common types of data iterations and associated analysis tasks and challenges. To help attribute data iterations to model performance, we design a collection of interactive visualizations and integrate them into a prototype, Chameleon, that lets users compare data features, training/testing splits, and performance across data versions. We present two case studies where developers apply \system to their own evolving datasets on production ML projects.

We also present the results of a series of crowd-sourced experiments in which we examine how y-axis truncation impacts subjective effect size across visualization types, and we explore alternative designs that more directly alert viewers to this truncation. We find that the subjective impact of axis truncation is persistent across visualizations designs, even for designs with explicit visual cues that indicate truncation has taken place.

CHI,2020,MRAT: The Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit,10.1145/3313831.3376330,"Significant tool support exists for the development of mixed reality (MR) applications; however, there is a lack of tools for analyzing MR experiences. We elicit requirements for future tools through interviews with 8 university research, instructional, and media teams using AR/VR in a variety of domains. While we find a common need for capturing how users perform tasks in MR, the primary differences were in terms of heuristics and metrics relevant to each project. Particularly in the early project stages, teams were uncertain about what data should, and even could, be collected with MR technologies. We designed the Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit (MRAT) to instrument MR apps via visual editors without programming and enable rapid data collection and filtering for visualizations of MR user sessions. With MRAT, we contribute flexible interaction tracking and task definition concepts, an extensible set of heuristic techniques and metrics to measure task success, and visual inspection tools with in-situ visualizations in MR. Focusing on a multi-user, cross-device MR crisis simulation and triage training app as a case study, we then show the benefits of using MRAT, not only for user testing of MR apps, but also performance tuning throughout the design process.",Michael Nebeling;Maximilian Speicher;Xizi Wang;Shwetha Rajaram;Brian D.

CHI,2020,Dear Pictograph: Investigating the Role of Personalization and Immersion for Consuming and Enjoying Visualizations,10.1145/3313831.3376348,"Much of the visualization literature focuses on assessment of visual representations with regard to their effectiveness for understanding data. In the present work, we instead focus on making data visualization experiences more enjoyable, to foster deeper engagement with data. We investigate two strategies to make visualization experiences more enjoyable and engaging: personalization, and immersion. We selected pictographs (composed of multiple data glyphs) as this representation affords creative freedom, allowing people to craft symbolic or whimsical shapes of personal significance to represent data. We present the results of a qualitative study with 12 participants crafting pictographs using a large pen-enabled device and while immersed within a VR environment.

CHI,2020,A Comparison of Geographical Propagation Visualizations,10.1145/3313831.3376350,"Geographical propagation phenomena occur in multiple domains, such as in epidemiology and social media. Propagation dynamics are often complex, and visualizations play a key role in helping subject-matter experts understand and analyze them. However, there is little empirical data about the effectiveness of the various strategies used to visualize geographical propagation. To fill this gap, we conduct an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies: an animated map, small-multiple maps, and a single map with glyphs. We compare them under five tasks that vary in one of the following dimensions: propagation scope, direction, speed, peaks, and spatial jumps. Our results show that small-multiple maps perform best overall, but that the effectiveness of each visualization varies depending on the task considered.",Vanessa Peña Araya;Anastasia Bezerianos;Emmanuel Pietriga,,,

Du Bois wrapped bar charts enable better large-to-small bar comparison by wrapping large bars over a certain threshold. We first present two crowdsourcing experiments comparing wrapped and standard bar charts to evaluate (1) the benefit of wrapped bars in helping participants identify and compare values; (2) the characteristics of data most suitable for wrapped bars. In the first study (n=98) using real-world datasets, we find that wrapped bar charts lead to higher accuracy in identifying and estimating ratios between bars. In a follow-up study (n=190) with 13 simulated datasets, we find participants were consistently more accurate with wrapped bar charts when certain category values are disproportionate as measured by entropy and H-spread. Finally, in an in-lab study, we investigate participants' experience and strategies, leading to guidelines for when and how to use wrapped bar charts.",Alireza Karduni;Ryan Wesslen;Isaac Cho;Wenwen Dou,,,

CHI,2020,Prior Setting in Practice: Strategies and Rationales Used in Choosing Prior Distributions for Bayesian Analysis,10.1145/3313831.3376377,"Bayesian statistical analysis is steadily growing in popularity and use. Choosing priors is an integral part of Bayesian inference. While there exist extensive normative recommendations for prior setting, little is known about how priors are chosen in practice. We conducted a survey (N = 50) and interviews (N = 9) where we used interactive visualizations to elicit prior distributions from researchers experienced withBayesian statistics and asked them for rationales for those priors. We found that participants' experience and philosophy influence how much and what information they are willing to incorporate into their priors, manifesting as different levels of informativeness and skepticism. We also identified three broad strategies participants use to set their priors: centrality matching, interval matching, and visual mass allocation. We discovered that participants' understanding of the notion of 'weakly informative priors""-a commonly-recommended normative approach to prior setting-manifests very differently across participants. Our results have implications both for how to develop prior setting recommendations and how to design tools to elicit priors in Bayesian analysis.",Abhraneel Sarma;Matthew Kay 0001,,,
CHI,2020,Decipher: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Interpreting Unstructured Design Feedback from Multiple Providers,10.1145/3313831.3376380,"Feedback from diverse audiences can vary in focus, differ in structure, and contradict each other, making it hard to interpret and act on. While prior work has explored generating quality feedback, our work helps a designer interpret that feedback. Through a formative study with professional designers (N=10), we discovered that the interpretation process includes categorizing feedback, identifying valuable feedback, and prioritizing which feedback to incorporate in a revision. We also found that designers leverage feedback topic and sentiment, and the status of the provider to aid interpretation. Based on the findings, we created a new tool (Decipher) that enables designers to visualize and navigate a collection of feedback using its topic and sentiment structure. In a preliminary evaluation (N=20), we found that Decipher helped users feel less overwhelmed during feedback interpretation tasks and better attend to critical issues and conflicting opinions compared to using a typical document-editing tool.",Yu-Chun (Grace) Yen;Joy O.

CHI,2020,Evaluating Multivariate Network Visualization Techniques Using a Validated Design and Crowdsourcing Approach,10.1145/3313831.3376381,"Visualizing multivariate networks is challenging because of the trade-offs necessary for effectively encoding network topology and encoding the attributes associated with nodes and edges. A large number of multivariate network visualization techniques exist, yet there is little empirical guidance on their respective strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we describe a crowdsourced experiment, comparing node-link diagrams with on-node encoding and adjacency matrices with juxtaposed tables. We find that node-link diagrams are best suited for tasks that require close integration between the network topology and a few attributes. Adjacency matrices perform well for tasks related to clusters and when many attributes need to be considered. We also reflect on our method of using validated designs for empirically evaluating complex, interactive visualizations in a crowdsourced setting. We highlight the importance of training, compensation, and provenance tracking.",Carolina Nobre;Dylan Wootton;Lane Harrison;Alexander Lex,,,
CHI,2020,"See, Feel, Move: Player Behaviour Analysis through Combined Visualization of Gaze, Emotions, and Movement",10.1145/3313831.3376401,"Playtesting of games often relies on a mixed-methods approach to obtain more holistic insights about and, in turn, improve the player experience. However, triangulating the different data sources and visualizing them in an integrated manner such that they contextualize each other still proves challenging. Despite its potential value for gauging player behaviour, this area of research continues to be underexplored. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach that combines commonly tracked movement data with - from a visualization perspective rarely considered - gaze behaviour and emotional responses. We evaluated our approach through a qualitative expert study with five professional game developers. Our results show that both the individual visualization of gaze, emotions, and movement but especially their combination are valuable to understand and form hypotheses about player behaviour. At the same time, our results stress that careful attention needs to be paid to ensure that the visualization remains legible and does not obfuscate information.",Daniel Kepplinger;Günter Wallner;Simone Kriglstein;Michael Lankes,HM,,
CHI,2020,Toward Automated Feedback on Teacher Discourse to Enhance Teacher Learning,10.1145/3313831.3376418,"Like anyone, teachers need feedback to improve. Due to the high cost of human classroom observation, teachers receive infrequent feedback which is often more focused on evaluating performance than on improving practice. To address this critical barrier to teacher learning, we aim to provide teachers with detailed and actionable automated feedback. Towards this end, we developed an approach that enables teachers to easily record high-quality audio from their classes. Using this approach, teachers recorded 142 classroom sessions, of which 127 (89%) were usable. Next, we used speech recognition and machine learning to develop teacher-generalizable computer-scored estimates of key dimensions of teacher discourse. We found that automated models were moderately accurate when compared to human coders and that speech recognition errors did not influence performance. We conclude that authentic teacher discourse can be recorded and analyzed for automatic feedback. Our next step is to incorporate the automatic models into an interactive visualization tool that will provide teachers with objective feedback on the quality of their discourse.",Emily Jensen;Meghan Dale;Patrick J.

These failures can arise silently: a conclusion derived from a particular visualization may look plausible unless the analyst looks closer and discovers an issue with the backing data, visual specification, or their own assumptions. We term such silent but significant failures . We describe a conceptual model of mirages and show how they can be generated at every stage of the visual analytics process. We adapt a methodology from software testing, , as a way of automatically surfacing potential mirages at the visual encoding stage of analysis through modifications to the underlying data and chart specification. We show that metamorphic testing can reliably identify mirages across a variety of chart types with relatively little prior knowledge of the data or the domain.",Andrew M. McNutt;Gordon L.

To address these issues, we design an environment that seamlessly integrates all steps of a design and deployment workflow through its main features: i) an extension to Vega, ii) a preview, and iii) debug hints that facilitate valid combinations of static and augmented content. We inform our design through a design space with four ways to augment static visualizations. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our tool through examples, including books, posters, projections, wall-sized visualizations.

Meanwhile, the description is parsed to generate visual search requests. Based on the identification results and search requests, each descriptive sentence is displayed beside the described focal areas as annotations. Different sentences are presented in various scenes of the generated animation to promote a vivid step-by-step presentation. With a user-customized style, the animation can guide the audience's attention via proper highlighting such as emphasizing specific features or isolating part of the data.

CHI,2020,How Visualizing Inferential Uncertainty Can Mislead Readers About Treatment Effects in Scientific Results,10.1145/3313831.3376454,"When presenting visualizations of experimental results, scientists often choose to display either inferential uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty in the estimate of a population mean) or outcome uncertainty (e.g., variation of outcomes around that mean) about their estimates. How does this choice impact readers' beliefs about the size of treatment effects? We investigate this question in two experiments comparing 95% confidence intervals (means and standard errors) to 95% prediction intervals (means and standard deviations). The first experiment finds that participants are willing to pay more for and overestimate the effect of a treatment when shown confidence intervals relative to prediction intervals. The second experiment evaluates how alternative visualizations compare to standard visualizations for different effect sizes. We find that axis rescaling reduces error, but not as well as prediction intervals or animated hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), and that depicting inferential uncertainty causes participants to underestimate variability in individual outcomes.",Jake M.

CHI,2020,A Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics,10.1145/3313831.3376466,"Visualizations depicting probabilities and uncertainty are used everywhere from medical risk communication to machine learning, yet these probabilistic visualizations are difficult to specify, prone to error, and their designs are cumbersome to explore. We propose a Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics (PGoG), an extension to Wilkinson's original framework. Inspired by the success of probabilistic programming languages, PGoG makes probability expressions, such as P(A|B), a first-class citizen in the language. PGoG abstractions also reflect the distinction between probability and frequency framing, a concept from the uncertainty communication literature. It is expressive, encompassing product plots, density plots, icon arrays, and dotplots, among other visualizations. Its coherent syntax ensures correctness (that the proportions of visual elements and their spatial placement reflect the underlying probability distribution) and reduces edit distance between probabilistic visualization specifications, potentially supporting more design exploration. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of PGoG in R.",Xiaoying Pu;Matthew Kay 0001,HM,,

We conducted an interdisciplinary review of 112 papers and tools from the database, visualisation and HCI communities. To better understand whether academic and industry approaches are meeting the needs of users, we interviewed 20 database users (and some designers), and found surprising results. In particular, there seems to be a wide gulf between users' debugging strategies and the functionality implemented in existing DBMSs, as well as proposed in the literature.

CHI,2020,Projection Boxes: On-the-fly Reconfigurable Visualization for Live Programming,10.1145/3313831.3376494,"Live programming is a regime in which the programming environment provides continual feedback, most often in the form of runtime values. In this paper, we present Projection Boxes, a novel visualization technique for displaying runtime values of programs. The key idea behind projection boxes is to start with a full semantics of the program, and then use projections to pick a subset of the semantics to display. By varying the projection used, projection boxes can encode both previously known visualization techniques, and also new ones. As such, projection boxes provide an expressive and configurable framework for displaying runtime information. Through a user study we demonstrate that (1) users find projection boxes and their configurability useful (2) users are not distracted by the always-on visualization (3) a key driving force behind the need for a configurable visualization for live programming lies with the wide variation in programmer preferences.",Sorin Lerner,,,

The process includes helping users easily understand what is happing to IAQ (awareness), what it means to them (understanding), and what to do with the information (action), which results in two outcomes, knowledge gain and emotional relief.

CHI,2020,Progression Maps: Conceptualizing Narrative Structure for Interaction Design Support,10.1145/3313831.3376527,"Interactive narratives are frequently designed for learning and training applications, such as social training. In these contexts, designers may be inexperienced in storytelling and interaction design, and it may be difficult to quickly build an effective experience, even for experienced designers. Designers often approach this problem through iterative design. To augment and reduce iteration, we argue for the utility of employing models to reason about, evaluate, and improve designs. While there has been much previous work on interactive narrative models, none of them capture aspects of the interaction design necessary for testing and evaluation. In this paper we propose a new computational model called Progression Maps, which abstracts interaction design elements of the narrative's structure and visualizes its interaction properties. We report on the model, its implementation, and two studies evaluating its use.

We confirm that researchers may experiment with choices in search of desirable results, but also identify other reasons why researchers explore alternatives yet omit findings. In concert with our interviews, we also contribute visualizations for communicating decision processes throughout an analysis.

To exemplify how the proposed interactions collectively facilitate data exploration, we employ them in a tablet-based system, InChorus that supports pen, touch, and speech input. Based on a study with 12 participants performing replication and factchecking tasks with InChorus, we discuss how participants adapted to using multimodal input and highlight considerations for future multimodal visualization systems.",Arjun Srinivasan;Bongshin Lee;Nathalie Henry Riche;Steven Mark Drucker;Ken Hinckley,HM,,
CHI,2020,Would you do it?: Enacting Moral Dilemmas in Virtual Reality for Understanding Ethical Decision-Making,10.1145/3313831.3376788,"A moral dilemma is a decision-making paradox without unambiguously acceptable or preferable options. This paper investigates if and how the virtual enactment of two renowned moral dilemmas---the Trolley and the Mad Bomber---influence decision-making when compared with mentally visualizing such situations. We conducted two user studies with two gender-balanced samples of 60 participants in total that compared between paper-based and virtual-reality (VR) conditions, while simulating 5 distinct scenarios for the Trolley dilemma, and 4 storyline scenarios for the Mad Bomber's dilemma. Our findings suggest that the VR enactment of moral dilemmas further fosters utilitarian decision-making, while it amplifies biases such as sparing juveniles and seeking retribution. Ultimately, we theorize that the VR enactment of renowned moral dilemmas can yield ecologically-valid data for training future Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems on ethical decision-making, and we elicit early design principles for the training of such systems.",Evangelos Niforatos;Adam Palma;Roman Gluszny;Athanasios Vourvopoulos;Fotis Liarokapis,,,
CHI,2020,RunAhead: Exploring Head Scanning based Navigation for Runners,10.1145/3313831.3376828,"Navigation systems for runners commonly provide turn-by-turn directions via voice and/or map-based visualizations. While voice directions require permanent attention, map-based guidance requires regular consultation. Both disrupt the running activity. To address this, we designed RunAhead, a navigation system using head scanning to query for navigation feedback, and we explored its suitability for runners in an outdoor experiment. In our design, we provide the runner with simple and intuitive navigation feedback on the path s/he is looking at through three different feedback modes: haptic, music and audio cues. In our experiment, we compare the resulting three versions of RunAhead with a baseline voice-based navigation system. We find that demand and error are equivalent across all four conditions. However, the head scanning based haptic and music conditions are preferred over the baseline and these preferences are impacted by runners' habits. With this study we contribute insights for designing navigation support for runners.",Danilo Gallo;Shreepriya Shreepriya;Jutta Willamowski,,,

In visualization pedagogy, design studies are often introduced but rarely practiced due to their large time requirements. This limits students to a classroom curriculum, often involving projects that may not have implications beyond the classroom. Thus we present the Design Study ""Lite"" Methodology, a novel framework for implementing design studies with novice students in 14 weeks. We utilized the Design Study ""Lite"" Methodology in conjunction with Service-Learning to teach five Data Visualization courses and demonstrate that it benefits not only the students but also the community through service to non-profit partners. In this paper, we provide a detailed breakdown of the methodology and how Service-Learning can be incorporated with it.

CHI,2020,Interaction Techniques for Visual Exploration Using Embedded Word-Scale Visualizations,10.1145/3313831.3376842,"We describe a design space of view manipulation interactions for small data-driven contextual visualizations (word-scale visualizations). These interaction techniques support an active reading experience and engage readers through exploration of embedded visualizations whose placement and content connect them to specific terms in a document. A reader could, for example, use our proposed interaction techniques to explore word-scale visualizations of stock market trends for companies listed in a market overview article. When readers wish to engage more deeply with the data, they can collect, arrange, compare, and navigate the document using the embedded word-scale visualizations, permitting more visualization-centric analyses. We support our design space with a concrete implementation, illustrate it with examples from three application domains, and report results from two experiments. The experiments show how view manipulation interactions helped readers examine embedded visualizations more quickly and with less scrolling and yielded qualitative feedback on usability and future opportunities.",Pascal Goffin;Tanja Blascheck;Petra Isenberg;Wesley Willett,,,
CHI,2020,Unwind: Interactive Fish Straightening,10.1145/3313831.3376846,"The ScanAllFish project is a large-scale effort to scan all the world's 33,100 known species of fishes. It has already generated thousands of volumetric CT scans of fish species which are available on open access platforms such as the Open Science Framework. To achieve a scanning rate required for a project of this magnitude, many specimens are grouped together into a single tube and scanned all at once. The resulting data contain many fish which are often bent and twisted to fit into the scanner. Our system, Unwind, is a novel interactive visualization and processing tool which extracts, unbends, and untwists volumetric images of fish with minimal user interaction. Our approach enables scientists to interactively unwarp these volumes to remove the undesired torque and bending using a piecewise-linear skeleton extracted by averaging isosurfaces of a harmonic function connecting the head and tail of each fish. The result is a volumetric dataset of a individual, straight fish in a canonical pose defined by the marine biologist expert user. We have developed Unwind in collaboration with a team of marine biologists: Our system has been deployed in their labs, and is presently being used for dataset construction, biomechanical analysis, and the generation of figures for scientific publication.",Francis Williams;Alexander Bock 0002;Harish Doraiswamy;Cassandra M.

In this setting, having a mid-air pointing device like a pen in the other hand greatly expands the interaction possibilities. For example, it lets users create 3D sketches and models while on the go. However, perceptual issues in Handheld AR make it difficult to judge the distance of a virtual object, making it hard to align a pen to it. To address this, we designed and compared different visualizations of the pen's position in its virtual environment, measuring pointing precision, task time, activation patterns, and subjective ratings of helpfulness, confidence, and comprehensibility of each visualization. While all visualizations resulted in only minor differences in precision and task time, subjective ratings of perceived helpfulness and confidence favor a 'heatmap' technique that colors the objects in the scene based on their distance to the pen.",Philipp Wacker;Adrian Wagner;Simon Voelker;Jan O.

CHI,2020,DFSeer: A Visual Analytics Approach to Facilitate Model Selection for Demand Forecasting,10.1145/3313831.3376866,"Selecting an appropriate model to forecast product demand is critical to the manufacturing industry. However, due to the data complexity, market uncertainty and users' demanding requirements for the model, it is challenging for demand analysts to select a proper model. Although existing model selection methods can reduce the manual burden to some extent, they often fail to present model performance details on individual products and reveal the potential risk of the selected model. This paper presents DFSeer, an interactive visualization system to conduct reliable model selection for demand forecasting based on the products with similar historical demand. It supports model comparison and selection with different levels of details. Besides, it shows the difference in model performance on similar products to reveal the risk of model selection and increase users' confidence in choosing a forecasting model.

However, across invocations such recommenders may lack the context of prior results, producing unstable outputs that override earlier design choices. To better balance automated suggestions with user intent, we contribute Dziban, a visualization API that supports both ambiguous specification and a novel anchoring mechanism for conveying desired context. Dziban uses the Draco knowledge base to automatically complete partial specifications and suggest appropriate visualizations. In addition, it extends Draco with chart similarity logic, enabling recommendations that also remain perceptually similar to a provided ""anchor"" chart. Existing APIs for exploratory visualization, such as ggplot2 and Vega-Lite, require fully specified chart definitions. In contrast, Dziban provides a more concise and flexible authoring experience through automated design, while preserving predictability and control through anchored recommendations.",Halden Lin;Dominik Moritz;Jeffrey Heer,,,

Authors use this medium to engage viewers with complex and sometimes controversial issues. A challenge for authors is to not only deliver new information, but to also overcome people's biases and misconceptions. We study how people adjust their attitudes toward (or away from) a message experienced through a narrative visualization. In a mixed-methods analysis, we investigate whether eliciting participants' prior beliefs, and visualizing those beliefs alongside actual data, can increase narrative persuasiveness. We find that incorporating priors does not significantly affect attitudinal change. However, participants who externalized their beliefs expressed greater surprise at the data. Their comments also indicated a greater likelihood of acquiring new information, despite the minimal change in attitude. Our results also extend prior findings, showing that visualizations are more persuasive than equivalent textual data representations for exposing contentious issues. We discuss the implications and outline future research directions.",Jeremy Heyer;Nirmal Kumar Raveendranath;Khairi Reda,,,

This work presents MindDot, a concept map-based learning environment that facilitates the cognitive process of comparing and integrating related concepts via two forms of support. A hyperlink support and an expert template. Study results suggested that both types of support had positive impact on the development of comparative strategies and that hyperlink support enhanced learning. We further evaluated the cognitive learning progress at a fine-grained level with two forms of visualizations. We then extracted several behavioral patterns that provided insights about the cognitive progress in learning.

CHI,2019,In a Silent Way: Communication Between AI and Improvising Musicians Beyond Sound,10.1145/3290605.3300268,"Collaboration is built on trust, and establishing trust with a creative Artificial Intelligence is difficult when the decision process or internal state driving its behaviour isn't exposed. When human musicians improvise together, a number of extra-musical cues are used to augment musical communication and expose mental or emotional states which affect musical decisions and the effectiveness of the collaboration. We developed a collaborative improvising AI drummer that communicates its confidence through an emoticon-based visualisation. The AI was trained on musical performance data, as well as real-time skin conductance, of musicians improvising with professional drummers, exposing both musical and extra-musical cues to inform its generative process. Uni- and bi-directional extra-musical communication with real and false values were tested by experienced improvising musicians. Each condition was evaluated using the FSS-2 questionnaire, as a proxy for musical engagement. The results show a positive correlation between extra-musical communication of machine internal state and human musical engagement.",Jon McCormack;Toby Gifford;Patrick Hutchings;Maria Teresa Llano Rodriguez;Matthew Yee-King;Mark d'Inverno,,,

Team members' embodied, multimodal interaction with each other and artefacts has been studied by researchers, but due to its complexity, has remained opaque to automated analysis. However, the ready availability of sensors makes it increasingly affordable to instrument work spaces to study teamwork and groupwork. The possibility of visualising key aspects of a collaboration has huge potential for both academic and professional learning, but a frontline challenge is the enrichment of quantitative data streams with the qualitative insights needed to make sense of them. In response, we introduce the concept of collaboration translucence, an approach to make visible selected features of group activity. This is grounded both theoretically (in the physical, epistemic, social and affective dimensions of group activity), and contextually (using domain-specific concepts). We illustrate the approach from the automated analysis of healthcare simulations to train nurses, generating four visual proxies that fuse multimodal data into higher order patterns.",Vanessa Echeverría;Roberto Martínez Maldonado;Simon Buckingham Shum,,,

Eye-tracking data in the in-lab experiment confirm that cues helped the viewers focus on relevant parts of the visualization faster. We found that in general, visual cues did not have a significant effect on learning outcomes, but for specific cue techniques (e.g. glow) or specific chart types (e.g heatmap), cues significantly improved comprehension. Based on these results, we discuss how presenters might select visual cues depending on the role of the cues and the visualization type.",Ha Kyung Kong;Wenjie Zhu;Zhicheng Liu 0001;Karrie Karahalios,,,

In these settings, digital artefacts can be located behind the user and out of their field of view - meaning that it can be difficult to notify the user when these artefacts need attention. Although much research has been carried out on notification, little is known about how best to direct people to the necessary location in room environments. We designed five diverse attention-guiding techniques for full-coverage display rooms, and evaluated them in a study where participants completed search tasks guided by the different techniques. Our study provides new results about notification in full-coverage displays: we showed benefits of persistent visualisations that could be followed all the way to the target and that indicate distance-to-target.

In this paper, we elaborate a method for value discovery, identifying how values impact the designer's decision making. We demonstrate the use of this method, called Ethicography, in describing value discovery and use throughout the design process. We present analysis of design activity by user experience (UX) design students in two lab protocol conditions, describing specific human values that designers considered for each task, and visualizing the interplay of these values.

CHI,2019,Evaluating the Impact of Pseudo-Colour and Coordinate System on the Detection of Medication-induced ECG Changes,10.1145/3290605.3300353,"The electrocardiogram (ECG), a graphical representation of the heart's electrical activity, is used for detecting cardiac pathologies. Certain medications can produce a complication known as 'long QT syndrome', shown on the ECG as an increased gap between two parts of the waveform. Self-monitoring for this could be lifesaving, as the syndrome can result in sudden death, but detecting it on the ECG is difficult. Here we evaluate whether using pseudo-colour to highlight wave length and changing the coordinate system can support lay people in identifying increases in the QT interval. The results show that introducing colour significantly improves accuracy, and that whilst it is easier to detect a difference without colour with Cartesian coordinates, the greatest accuracy is achieved when Polar coordinates are combined with colour.

First, we identify five key design choices made by analysts while creating visualizations, such as selecting a visualization type and choosing to encode a column along the X- or Y-axis. We train models to predict these design choices using one million dataset-visualization pairs collected from a popular online visualization platform. Neural networks predict these design choices with high accuracy compared to baseline models. We report and interpret feature importances from one of these baseline models. To evaluate the generalizability and uncertainty of our approach, we benchmark with a crowdsourced test set, and show that the performance of our model is comparable to human performance when predicting consensus visualization type, and exceeds that of other visualization recommender systems.",Kevin Zeng Hu;Michiel A.

Surprisingly however, most personal health tracking applications fail to disclose the accuracy of their measurements and predictions. In the case of fertility tracking applications (FTAs), inaccurate predictions have already led to numerous unwanted pregnancies and law suits. However, integrating uncertainty into FTAs is challenging: Prediction accuracy is hard to understand and communicate, and its effect on users' trust and behavior is not well understood. We created a prototype for uncertainty visualizations for FTAs and evaluated it in a four-week field study with real users and their own data (N=9). Our results uncover far-reaching effects of communicating uncertainty: For example, users interpreted prediction accuracy as a proxy for their cycle health and as a security indicator for contraception. Displaying predicted and detected fertile phases next to each other helped users to understand uncertainty without negative emotional effects.",Hanna Schneider;Julia Wayrauther;Mariam Hassib;Andreas Butz,,,

Furthermore, several new visual representations have recently been suggested in this area, including wrapped bars, packed bars, piled bars, and Zvinca plots. To quantify the differences and trade-offs for these ranked-list visualizations, we here report on a crowdsourced graphical perception study involving six such visual representations, including the ubiquitous scrolled barchart, in three tasks: ranking (assessing a single item), comparison (two items), and average (assessing global distribution).

We present an interaction technique, Perceptual Glimpses, which allows for the transparent presentation of so-called 'deceptive' views of information that are made temporary using quasimodes. When presented using Perceptual Glimpses, message-level exaggeration caused by a truncated axis on a bar chart was reduced under some conditions, but users require guidance to avoid errors, and view presentation order may affect trust.

CHI,2019,On the Shoulder of the Giant: A Multi-Scale Mixed Reality Collaboration with 360 Video Sharing and Tangible Interaction,10.1145/3290605.3300458,"We propose a multi-scale Mixed Reality (MR) collaboration between the Giant, a local Augmented Reality user, and the Miniature, a remote Virtual Reality user, in Giant-Miniature Collaboration (GMC). The Miniature is immersed in a 360-video shared by the Giant who can physically manipulate the Miniature through a tangible interface, a combined 360-camera with a 6 DOF tracker. We implemented a prototype system as a proof of concept and conducted a user study (n=24) comprising of four parts comparing: A) two types of virtual representations, B) three levels of Miniature control, C) three levels of 360-video view dependencies, and D) four 360-camera placement positions on the Giant. The results show users prefer a shoulder mounted camera view, while a view frustum with a complimentary avatar is a good visualization for the Miniature virtual representation. From the results, we give design recommendations and demonstrate an example Giant-Miniature Interaction.",Thammathip Piumsomboon;Gun A. Lee;Andrew Irlitti;Barrett Ens;Bruce H.

CHI,2019,Data is Personal: Attitudes and Perceptions of Data Visualization in Rural Pennsylvania,10.1145/3290605.3300474,"Many of the guidelines that inform how designers create data visualizations originate in studies that unintentionally exclude populations that are most likely to be among the 'data poor'. In this paper, we explore which factors may drive attention and trust in rural populations with diverse economic and educational backgrounds - a segment that is largely underrepresented in the data visualization literature. In 42 semi-structured interviews in rural Pennsylvania (USA), we find that a complex set of factors intermix to inform attitudes and perceptions about data visualization - including educational background, political affiliation, and personal experience.

CHI,2019,Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,10.1145/3290605.3300477,"Virtual reality (VR) can be immersive to such a degree that users sometimes report feeling tactile sensations based on visualization of the touch, without any actual physical contact. This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.",Filip Skola;Fotis Liarokapis,,,
CHI,2019,Thinking Too Classically: Research Topics in Human-Quantum Computer Interaction,10.1145/3290605.3300486,"Quantum computing is a fundamentally different way of performing computation than classical computing. Many problems that are considered hard for classical computers may have efficient solutions using quantum computers. Recently, technology companies including IBM, Microsoft, and Google have invested in developing both quantum computing hardware and software to explore the potential of quantum computing. Because of the radical shift in computing paradigms that quantum represents, we see an opportunity to study the unique needs people have when interacting with quantum systems, what we call Quantum HCI (QHCI). Based on interviews with experts in quantum computing, we identify four areas in which HCI researchers can contribute to the field of quantum computing. These areas include understanding current and future quantum users, tools for programming and debugging quantum algorithms, visualizations of quantum states, and educational materials to train the first generation of ""quantum native"" programmers.",Zahra Ashktorab;Justin D.

CHI,2019,Managing Messes in Computational Notebooks,10.1145/3290605.3300500,"Data analysts use computational notebooks to write code for analyzing and visualizing data. Notebooks help analysts iteratively write analysis code by letting them interleave code with output, and selectively execute cells. However, as analysis progresses, analysts leave behind old code and outputs, and overwrite important code, producing cluttered and inconsistent notebooks. This paper introduces code gathering tools, extensions to computational notebooks that help analysts find, clean, recover, and compare versions of code in cluttered, inconsistent notebooks. The tools archive all versions of code outputs, allowing analysts to review these versions and recover the subsets of code that produced them. These subsets can serve as succinct summaries of analysis activity or starting points for new analyses. In a qualitative usability study, 12 professional analysts found the tools useful for cleaning notebooks and writing analysis code, and discovered new ways to use them, like generating personal documentation and lightweight versioning.",Andrew Head;Fred Hohman;Titus Barik;Steven Mark Drucker;Robert DeLine,BP,,
CHI,2019,Frequency-Based Design of Smart Textiles,10.1145/3290605.3300524,"Despite the increasing amount of smart textile design practitioners, the methods and tools commonly available have not progressed to the same scale. Most smart textile interaction designs today rely on detecting changes in resistance. The tools and sensors for this are generally limited to DC-voltage-divider based sensors and multimeters. Furthermore, the textiles and the materials used in smart textile design can exhibit behaviour making it difficult to identify even simple interactions using those means. For instance, steel-based textiles exhibit intrinsic semiconductive properties that are difficult to identify with current methods. In this paper, we show an alternative way to measure interaction with smart textiles. By relying on visualisation known as Lissajous-figures and frequency-based signals, we can detect even subtle and varied forms of interaction with smart textiles. We also show an approach to measuring frequency-based signals and present an Arduino-based system called Teksig to support this type of textile practice.",Jussi Mikkonen;Riikka Townsend,,,
CHI,2019,Scaptics and Highlight-Planes: Immersive Interaction Techniques for Finding Occluded Features in 3D Scatterplots,10.1145/3290605.3300555,"Three-dimensional scatterplots suffer from well-known perception and usability problems. In particular, overplotting and occlusion, mainly due to density and noise, prevent users from properly perceiving the data. Thanks to accurate head and hand tracking, immersive Virtual Reality (VR) setups provide new ways to interact and navigate with 3D scatterplots. VR also supports additional sensory modalities such as haptic feedback. Inspired by methods commonly used in Scientific Visualisation to visually explore volumes, we propose two techniques that leverage the immersive aspects of VR: first, a density-based haptic vibration technique (Scaptics) which provides feedback through the controller; and second, an adaptation of a cutting plane for 3D scatterplots (Highlight-Plane). We evaluated both techniques in a controlled study with two tasks involving density (finding high- and low-density areas). Overall, Scaptics was the most time-efficient and accurate technique, however, in some conditions, it was outperformed by Highlight-Plane.",Arnaud Prouzeau;Maxime Cordeil;Clement Robin;Barrett Ens;Bruce H.

Working in complex, layered organizational structures, they face challenges of collaboration and communication. Online information is central to every phase of a human-trafficking investigation. With terabytes of available data such as sex work ads, policing is increasingly a big-data research problem. In this study, we interview sixteen law enforcement officers working to rescue victims of human trafficking to try to understand their computational needs. We highlight three major areas where future work in human-computer interaction can help. First, combating human trafficking requires advances in information visualization of large, complex, geospatial data, as victims are frequently forcibly moved across jurisdictions. Second, the need for unified information databases raises critical research issues of usable security and privacy. Finally, the archaic nature of information systems available to law enforcement raises policy issues regarding resource allocation for software development.",Julia Deeb-Swihart;Alex Endert;Amy S.

CHI,2019,Trust and Recall of Information across Varying Degrees of Title-Visualization Misalignment,10.1145/3290605.3300576,"Visualizations are emerging as a means of spreading digital misinformation. Prior work has shown that visualization interpretation can be manipulated through slanted titles that favor only one side of the visual story, yet people still think the visualization is impartial. In this work, we study whether such effects continue to exist when titles and visualizations exhibit greater degrees of misalignment: titles whose message differs from the visually cued message in the visualization, and titles whose message contradicts the visualization. We found that although titles with a contradictory slant triggered more people to identify bias compared to titles with a miscued slant, visualizations were persistently perceived as impartial by the majority. Further, people's recall of the visualization's message more frequently aligned with the titles than the visualization. Based on these results, we discuss the potential of leveraging textual components to detect and combat visual-based misinformation with text-based slants.",Ha Kyung Kong;Zhicheng Liu 0001;Karrie Karahalios,,,
CHI,2019,Aggregated Visualization of Playtesting Data,10.1145/3290605.3300593,"Playtesting is a key component in the game development process aimed at improving the quality of games through the collection of gameplay data and identification of design issues. Visualization techniques are currently being employed to help integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Despite that, two existing challenges are to determine the level of detail to be presented to developers based on their needs and to effectively communicate the collected data so that informed design changes can be reached. In this paper, we first propose an aggregated visualization technique that makes use of clustering, territory tessellation, and trajectory aggregation to simultaneously display mixed playtesting data. Secondly, to assess the usefulness of our technique we evaluate it through interviews with professional game developers and compare it to a non-aggregated visualization. The results of this study also provide an important contribution towards identifying areas of improvement in the portrayal of gameplay data.",Günter Wallner;Nour Halabi;Pejman Mirza-Babaei,,,
CHI,2019,Bookly: An Interactive Everyday Artifact Showing the Time of Physically Accumulated Reading Activity,10.1145/3290605.3300614,"We introduce Bookly, an interactive artifact that physically represents the accumulated time of users' reading activity through abstract volumetric changes. Bookly accumulates the time of actions (e.g., picking up and putting down books) that users performed for reading and provides a designated space for the ongoing book being read. The results of our 2-week in-field study with six participants showed that continuous exposure to volumetric changes representing the accumulated time of reading activities helped the users to understand their unsettled reading patterns. Bookly also motivated the users to improve their reading behavior by gradually making reading part of their schedules. Additionally, the definite distinction of the ongoing book improved its visual affordance and accessibility for the users to start reading books. Based on the findings, we confirmed the possibility of making intangible data physical for self-reflection to enhance changes in behaviors that are difficult to perform due to weak motivation.",Somi Ju;Kyung-Ryong Lee;Subin Kim;Young-Woo Park,,,

Once the requester captures a picture of the desired composition and delivers it to the user (photographer), a 2.5D guidance system, called the virtual frame, guides the user in real-time by showing a three-dimensional composition of the target image (i.e., size and shape). In addition, according to the matching accuracy rate, we provide a small-sized target image in an inset window as feedback and edge visualization for further alignment of the detail elements. We implemented PicMe to work fully in mobile environments. We then conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the effectiveness of PicMe compared to traditional 2D guidance methods. The results show that PicMe helps users reach their target images more accurately and quickly by giving participants more confidence in their tasks.",Minju Kim;Jungjin Lee,BP,,
CHI,2019,Color Builder: A Direct Manipulation Interface for Versatile Color Theme Authoring,10.1145/3290605.3300686,"Color themes or palettes are popular for sharing color combinations across many visual domains. We present a novel interface for creating color themes through direct manipulation of color swatches. Users can create and rearrange swatches, and combine them into smooth and step-based gradients and three-color blends -- all using a seamless touch or mouse input. Analysis of existing solutions reveals a fragmented color design workflow, where separate software is used for swatches, smooth and discrete gradients and for in-context color visualization. Our design unifies these tasks, while encouraging playful creative exploration. Adjusting a color using standard color pickers can break this interaction flow with mechanical slider manipulation. To keep interaction seamless, we additionally design an in situ color tweaking interface for freeform exploration of an entire color neighborhood. We evaluate our interface with a group of professional designers and students majoring in this field.",Maria Shugrina;Wenjia Zhang;Fanny Chevalier;Sanja Fidler;Karan Singh,,,

This paper presents Eye-Write, a novel system which allows two co-authors to see at will the location of their partner's gaze within a text editor. To investigate the effect of shared gaze on collaboration, we conducted a study on synchronous remote collaborative writing in academic settings with 20 dyads. Gaze sharing improved five aspects of perceived collaboration quality: mutual understanding, level of joint attention, flow of communication, level of negotiation, and awareness of the co-author's activity. Furthermore, dyads whose participants deactivated the gaze visualization showed a smaller degree of collaboration. Our findings offer insights for future text editors by outlining the benefits of at-will gaze sharing in collaborative writing.",Grete Helena Kütt;Kevin Lee;Ethan Hardacre;Alexandra Papoutsaki,,,

Digital technologies provide tools that can help people envision these possibilities. We explore this combination through a performance workshop process designed to help stroke survivors imagine new physical and social possibilities by enacting fantasies of ""things they always wanted to do"". This process uses performance methods combined with specially designed real-time movement visualisations to progressively build fantasy narratives that are enacted with and for other workshop participants. Qualitative evaluations suggest this process successfully stimulates participant's embodied imagination and generates a diverse range of fantasies. The interactive and communal aspects of the workshop process appear to be especially important in achieving these effects.

CHI,2019,Saliency Deficit and Motion Outlier Detection in Animated Scatterplots,10.1145/3290605.3300771,"We report the results of a crowdsourced experiment that measured the accuracy of motion outlier detection in multivariate, animated scatterplots. The targets were outliers either in speed or direction of motion, and were presented with varying levels of saliency in dimensions that are irrelevant to the task of motion outlier detection (e.g., color, size, position). We found that participants had trouble finding the outlier when it lacked irrelevant salient features and that visual channels contribute unevenly to the odds of an outlier being correctly detected. Direction of motion contributes the most to accurate detection of speed outliers, and position contributes the most to accurate detection of direction outliers. We introduce the concept of saliency deficit in which item importance in the data space is not reflected in the visualization due to a lack of saliency. We conclude that motion outlier detection is not well supported in multivariate animated scatterplots.",Rafael Veras;Christopher Collins 0001,HM,,

However, interaction designers are rarely engineers, and 30 years of haptic inventions are buried in a fragmented literature that describes devices mechanically rather than by potential purpose. We conceived of Haptipedia to unlock this trove of examples: Haptipedia presents a device corpus for exploration through metadata that matter to both device and interaction designers. It is a taxonomy of device attributes that go beyond physical description to capture potential utility, applied to a growing database of 105 grounded force-feedback devices, and accessed through a public visualization that links utility to morphology. Haptipedia's design was driven by both systematic review of the haptic device literature and rich input from diverse haptic designers.

CHI,2019,Gamut: A Design Probe to Understand How Data Scientists Understand Machine Learning Models,10.1145/3290605.3300809,"Without good models and the right tools to interpret them, data scientists risk making decisions based on hidden biases, spurious correlations, and false generalizations. This has led to a rallying cry for model interpretability. Yet the concept of interpretability remains nebulous, such that researchers and tool designers lack actionable guidelines for how to incorporate interpretability into models and accompanying tools. Through an iterative design process with expert machine learning researchers and practitioners, we designed a visual analytics system, Gamut, to explore how interactive interfaces could better support model interpretation. Using Gamut as a probe, we investigated why and how professional data scientists interpret models, and how interface affordances can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability. Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept: data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences, often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness.

In contrast to existing UI distribution systems, we are able to infer all required information by analyzing the visualizations and devices without relying on additional input provided by users or programmers. In a qualitative study, we let experts create their own distributions and rate both other manual distributions and our automatic ones.

PeerLens can recommend a customized, adaptable sequence of practice questions to individual learners, based on the exercise history of other users in a similar learning scenario. We propose a new way to model the learning path by submission types and a novel visual design to facilitate the understanding and planning of the learning path. We conducted a within-subject experiment to assess the efficacy and usefulness of PeerLens in comparison with two baseline systems.

VizNet provides the necessary common baseline for comparing visualization design techniques, and developing benchmark models and algorithms for automating visual analysis. To demonstrate VizNet's utility as a platform for conducting online crowdsourced experiments at scale, we replicate a prior study assessing the influence of user task and data distribution on visual encoding effectiveness, and extend it by considering an additional task: outlier detection.

CHI,2019,"Measuring the Separability of Shape, Size, and Color in Scatterplots",10.1145/3290605.3300899,"Scatterplots commonly use multiple visual channels to encode multivariate datasets. Such visualizations often use size, shape, and color as these dimensions are considered separable--dimensions represented by one channel do not significantly interfere with viewers' abilities to perceive data in another. However, recent work shows the size of marks significantly impacts color difference perceptions, leading to broader questions about the separability of these channels. In this paper, we present a series of crowdsourced experiments measuring how mark shape, size, and color influence data interpretation in multiclass scatterplots. Our results indicate that mark shape significantly influences color and size perception, and that separability among these channels functions asymmetrically: shape more strongly influences size and color perceptions in scatterplots than size and color influence shape. Models constructed from the resulting data can help designers anticipate viewer perceptions to build more effective visualizations.",Stephen Smart;Danielle Albers Szafir,,,

To address these issues, we design and implement ATMSeer, an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and in analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer, we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts. A multi-granularity visualization is proposed to enable users to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the searched models, and refine the search space in real time.

We demonstrate a Bayesian cognitive model for understanding how people interpret visualizations in light of prior beliefs and show how this model provides a guide for improving visualization evaluation. In a first study, we show how applying a Bayesian cognition model to a simple visualization scenario indicates that people's judgments are consistent with a hypothesis that they are doing approximate Bayesian inference. In a second study, we evaluate how sensitive our observations of Bayesian behavior are to different techniques for eliciting people subjective distributions, and to different datasets. We find that people don't behave consistently with Bayesian predictions for large sample size datasets, and this difference cannot be explained by elicitation technique. In a final study, we show how normative Bayesian inference can be used as an evaluation framework for visualizations, including of uncertainty.",Yea-Seul Kim;Logan A. Walls;Peter M.

To optimize latency-sensitive brushing actions, Falcon reindexes data upon changes to the active view a user is brushing in. To limit view switching times, Falcon initially loads reduced interactive resolutions, then progressively improves them. Benchmarks show that Falcon sustains real-time interactivity of 50fps for pixel-level brushing and linking across multiple visualizations with no costly precomputation.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of a gesture's orientation on how well the gesture can be performed. We conducted a study in which participants performed systematically rotated unistroke gestures. For straight lines as well as for compound lines, we found that users tend to align gestures with the primary axes. We show that the error can be described by a Clausen function with R² = .93.

CHI,2018,When David Meets Goliath: Combining Smartwatches with a Large Vertical Display for Visual Data Exploration,10.1145/3173574.3173593,"We explore the combination of smartwatches and a large interactive display to support visual data analysis. These two extremes of interactive surfaces are increasingly popular, but feature different characteristics-display and input modalities, personal/public use, performance, and portability. In this paper, we first identify possible roles for both devices and the interplay between them through an example scenario. We then propose a conceptual framework to enable analysts to explore data items, track interaction histories, and alter visualization configurations through mechanisms using both devices in combination. We validate an implementation of our framework through a formative evaluation and a user study. The results show that this device combination, compared to just a large display, allows users to develop complex insights more fluidly by leveraging the roles of the two devices. Finally, we report on the interaction patterns and interplay between the devices for visual exploration as observed during our study.",Tom Horak;Sriram Karthik Badam;Niklas Elmqvist;Raimund Dachselt,HM,,
CHI,2018,Flexible and Mindful Self-Tracking: Design Implications from Paper Bullet Journals,10.1145/3173574.3173602,"Digital self-tracking technologies offer many potential benefits over self-tracking with paper notebooks. However, they are often too rigid to support people's practical and emotional needs in everyday settings. To inform the design of more flexible self-tracking tools, we examine bullet journaling: an analogue and customisable approach for logging and reflecting on everyday life. Analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on Instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to their changing practical and emotional needs through: (1) creating and combining personally meaningful visualisations of different types of trackers, such as habit, mood, and symptom trackers; (2) engaging in mindful reflective thinking through design practices and self-reflective strategies; and (3) posting photos of paper journals online to become part of a self-tracking culture of sharing and learning. We outline two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful self-tracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice.",Amid Ayobi;Tobias Sonne;Paul Marshall;Anna L.

CHI,2018,Exploration and Explanation in Computational Notebooks,10.1145/3173574.3173606,"Computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. Researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. We present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. In the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on GitHub, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. In a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. In a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. Importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. These studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. We conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",Adam Rule;Aurélien Tabard;James D. Hollan,HM,,

Conventional exploration requires users to navigate across multiple scales but only presents the information related to the current scale. This limitation potentially adds more steps of interaction and cognitive overload to the users. TopoText renders multi-scale aggregates into a single visual display combining novel text-based encoding and layout methods that draw labels along the boundary or filled within the aggregates. The text itself not only summarizes the semantics at each individual scale, but also indicates the spatial coverage of the aggregates and their underlying hierarchical relationships.

While comics are widely known, few examples of data comics exist and there has not been any structured analysis nor guidance for their creation. We introduce data-comic design-patterns, each describing a set of panels with a specific narrative purpose, that allow for rapid storyboarding of data comics while showcasing their expressive potential. Our patterns are derived from i) analyzing common patterns in infographics, datavideos, and existing data comics, ii) our experiences creating data comics for different scenarios. Our patterns demonstrate how data comics allow an author to combine the best of both worlds: spatial layout and overview from infographics as well as linearity and narration from videos and presentations.",Benjamin Bach;Zezhong Wang 0001;Matteo Farinella;Dave Murray-Rust;Nathalie Henry Riche,,,

Substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. We present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. A participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. We then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. We also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change.",Alan Yusheng Wu;Cosmin Munteanu,,,

To better support designers' workflows and practices, we propose Data Illustrator, a novel visualization framework. In our approach, all visualizations are initially vector graphics; data binding is applied when necessary and only constrains interactive manipulation to that data bound property. The framework augments graphic design tools with new concepts and operators, and describes the structure and generation of a variety of visualizations. Based on the framework, we design and implement a visualization authoring system. The system extends interaction techniques in modern vector design tools for direct manipulation of visualization configurations and parameters.

CHI,2018,The Effects of Adding Search Functionality to Interactive Visualizations on the Web,10.1145/3173574.3173711,"The widespread use of text-based search in user interfaces has led designers in visualization to occasionally add search functionality to their creations. Yet it remains unclear how search may impact a person's behavior. Given the unstructured context of the web, users may not have explicit information-seeking goals and designers cannot make assumptions about user attention. To bridge this gap, we observed the impact of integrating search with five visualizations across 830 online participants. In an unguided task, we find that (1) the presence of text-based search influences people's information-seeking goals, (2) search can alter the data that people explore and how they engage with it, and (3) the effects of search are amplified in visualizations where people are familiar with the underlying dataset. These results suggest that text-search in web visualizations drives users towards more diverse information seeking goals, and may be valuable in a range of existing visualization designs.",Mi Feng;Cheng Deng;Evan M.

Through research, design, implementation, and informal evaluation of our new tool, we developed principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. We offer these principles as a step towards understanding the complex task of designing these systems.

Evaluations of uncertainty displays for transit prediction have assessed people's ability to extract probabilities, but not the quality of their decisions. In a controlled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncertainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). Frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to better extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better decisions. Decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were(1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97% of optimal(95% CI: [95%,98%]), 5 percentage points more than control (95% CI: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95% CI:[2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95% CI: [2,6]).Cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated.

To visualize these networks and communicate them in publications, biologists must manually position the nodes and edges of each network to reflect their real-world physical structure. This process does not scale well, and graph layout algorithms lack the biological underpinnings to offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we present CrowdLayout, a crowdsourcing system that leverages human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. CrowdLayout provides design guidelines, abstractions, and editing tools to help novice workers perform like experts. We evaluated CrowdLayout in two experiments with paid crowd workers and real biological network data, finding that crowds could both create and evaluate meaningful, high-quality layouts.

By characterizing user requirements and analytical tasks in the context of finding ideal homes, we designed ReACH, a novel visual analytics system that assists people in finding, evaluating, and choosing a home based on multiple criteria, including reachability. In addition, we developed an improved data-driven model for approximating reachability with massive taxi trajectories. This model enables users to interactively integrate their knowledge and preferences to make judicious and informed decisions.

This socially competitive dimension is lacking in most online games, where players are out of sight of each other. We conducted a lab study using a strategic online game; finding that (1) players are better at discerning their opponent's plans when shown a live visualisation of the opponent's gaze, and (2) players who are aware that their gaze is tracked will manipulate their gaze to keep their intentions hidden. We describe the strategies that players employed, to various degrees of success, to deceive their opponent through their gaze behaviour.

We present a general framework for human-designable visual markers for artists to encode specific bit representations in large spaces. A three-part study, conducted over three weeks, methodically evaluates the usability of different encoding methods when artists encode specific bit representations. The methods span different shape characteristics suitable for artist encoding (convexity, hollowness, number, size, and distance from centroid) and visualization tools are proposed to aid in this process. We further demonstrate that any of the methods presented may be practically used to encode a URL with the aid of a universally available database like TinyURL (rather than a task-specific database), making human-designable visual markers practical for applications such as advertisements.",Joshua D.

Virtual Reality (VR) presents a challenge as neither the user's hands nor the physical input devices are directly visible. Hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. We developed a apparatus that tracks the user's hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in VR. In a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. With our apparatus, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-VR performance. Inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 WPM slower than with a regular desktop setup.

There are many ways to visualize characteristics of eye movements, such as a path connecting fixation points or a heat map illustrating fixation duration and coverage. In this study, we designed and evaluated three unique gaze visualizations in a remote search task. Our results suggest that the design of gaze visualizations affects performance, coordination, searching behavior, and perceived utility. Additionally, the degree of task coupling further influences the effect of gaze visualizations on performance and coordination.

Understanding and Supporting the Use of Visualization for Clinical Text Overview,10.1145/3173574.3173996,"Clinical practice is heavily reliant on the use of unstructured text to document patient stories due to its expressive and flexible nature. However, a physician's capacity to recover information from text for clinical overview is severely affected when records get longer and time pressure increases. Data visualization strategies have been explored to aid in information retrieval by replacing text with graphical summaries, though often at the cost of omitting important text features. This causes physician mistrust and limits real-world adoption. This work presents our investigation into the role and use of text in clinical practice, and reports on efforts to assess the best of both worlds---text and visualization---to facilitate clinical overview. We report on insights garnered from a field study, and the lessons learned from an iterative design process and evaluation of a text-visualization prototype, MedStory, with 14 medical professionals.

We study frames in visualization titles, and how the slanted framing of titles and the viewer's pre-existing attitude impact recall, perception of bias, and change of attitude. When asked to compose visualization titles, people used five existing news frames, an open-ended frame, and a statistics frame. We found that the slant of the title influenced the perceived main message of a visualization, with viewers deriving opposing messages from the same visualization. The results did not show any significant effect on attitude change. We highlight the danger of subtle statistics frames and viewers' unwarranted conviction of the neutrality of visualizations.

CHI,2018,Investigating the Effect of the Multiple Comparisons Problem in Visual Analysis,10.1145/3173574.3174053,"The goal of a visualization system is to facilitate dataset-driven insight discovery. But what if the insights are spurious? Features or patterns in visualizations can be perceived as relevant insights, even though they may arise from noise. We often compare visualizations to a mental image of what we are interested in: a particular trend, distribution or an unusual pattern. As more visualizations are examined and more comparisons are made, the probability of discovering spurious insights increases. This problem is well-known in Statistics as the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) but overlooked in visual analysis. We present a way to evaluate MCP in visualization tools by measuring the accuracy of user reported insights on synthetic datasets with known ground truth labels. In our experiment, over 60% of user insights were false. We show how a confirmatory analysis approach that accounts for all visual comparisons, insights and non-insights, can achieve similar results as one that requires a validation dataset.",Emanuel Zgraggen;Zheguang Zhao;Robert C.

This paper proposes that qualitative indexical visualizations based on learned understanding of physical phenomena (Experiential Augmentation) can enhance our interaction design language and aid digital interfaces in communicating in a real-world context. We present a study that gathers data on how participants interpret such visualizations, and propose a model with which to analyze their responses. Finally, we also give a set of design recommendations for those interested in creating similar augmentations.",Dixon Lo;Dan Lockton;Stacie Rohrbach,,,
CHI,2018,T-Cal: Understanding Team Conversational Data with Calendar-based Visualization,10.1145/3173574.3174074,"Understanding team communication and collaboration patterns is critical for improving work efficiency in organizations. This paper presents an interactive visualization system, T-Cal, that supports the analysis of conversation data from modern team messaging platforms (e.g., Slack). T-Cal employs a user-familiar visual interface, a calendar, to enable seamless multi-scale browsing of data from different perspectives. T-Cal also incorporates a number of analytical techniques for disentangling interleaving conversations, extracting keywords, and estimating sentiment. The design of T-Cal is based on an iterative user-centered design process including interview studies, requirements gathering, initial prototypes demonstration, and evaluation with domain users. The resulting two case studies indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of T-Cal in real-world applications, including daily conversations within an industry research lab and student group chats in a MOOC.",Siwei Fu;Jian Zhao 0010;Hao Fei Cheng;Haiyi Zhu;Jennifer Marlow,,,
CHI,2018,Uncertainty Visualization Influences how Humans Aggregate Discrepant Information,10.1145/3173574.3174079,"The number of sensors in our surroundings that provide the same information steadily increases. Since sensing is prone to errors, sensors may disagree. For example, a GPS-based tracker on the phone and a sensor on the bike wheel may provide discrepant estimates on traveled distance. This poses a user dilemma, namely how to reconcile the conflicting information into one estimate. We investigated whether visualizing the uncertainty associated with sensor measurements improves the quality of users' inference. We tested four visualizations with increasingly detailed representation of uncertainty. Our study repeatedly presented two sensor measurements with varying degrees of inconsistency to participants who indicated their best guess of the ""true"" value. We found that uncertainty information improves users' estimates, especially if sensors differ largely in their associated variability. Improvements were larger for information-rich visualizations. Based on our findings, we provide an interactive tool to select the optimal visualization for displaying conflicting information.",Miriam Greis;Aditi Joshi;Ken Singer;Albrecht Schmidt 0001;Tonja Machulla,,,
CHI,2018,CraftML: 3D Modeling is Web Programming,10.1145/3173574.3174101,"We explore web programming as a new paradigm for programmatic 3D modeling. Most existing approaches subscribe to the imperative programming paradigm. While useful, there exists a gulf of evaluation between procedural steps and the intended structure. We present CraftML, a language providing a declarative syntax where the code is the structure. CraftML offers a rich set of programming features familiar to web developers of all skill levels, such as tags, hyperlinks, document object model, cascade style sheet, JQuery, string interpolation, template engine, data injection, and scalable vector graphics. We develop an online IDE to support CraftML development, with features such as live preview, search, module import, and parameterization. Using examples and case studies, we demonstrate that CraftML offers a low floor for beginners to make simple designs, a high ceiling for experts to build complex computational models, and wide walls to support many application domains such as education, data physicalization, tactile graphics, assistive devices, and mechanical components.",Tom Yeh;Jeeeun Kim,,,
CHI,2018,Augmenting Code with In Situ Visualizations to Aid Program Understanding,10.1145/3173574.3174106,"Programmers must draw explicit connections between their code and runtime state to properly assess the correctness of their programs. However, debugging tools often decouple the program state from the source code and require explicitly invoked views to bridge the rift between program editing and program understanding. To unobtrusively reveal runtime behavior during both normal execution and debugging, we contribute techniques for visualizing program variables directly within the source code. We describe a design space and placement criteria for embedded visualizations. We evaluate our in situ visualizations in an editor for the Vega visualization grammar. Compared to a baseline development environment, novice Vega users improve their overall task grade by about 2 points when using the in situ visualizations and exhibit significant positive effects on their self-reported speed and accuracy.",Jane Hoffswell;Arvind Satyanarayan;Jeffrey Heer,,,
CHI,2018,Pictures Worth a Thousand Words: Reflections on Visualizing Personal Blood Glucose Forecasts for Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes,10.1145/3173574.3174112,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic condition that requires management of one's lifestyle, including nutrition. Critically, patients often lack a clear understanding of how everyday meals impact their blood glucose. New predictive analytics approaches can provide personalized mealtime blood glucose forecasts. While communicating forecasts can be challenging, effective strategies for doing so remain little explored. In this study, we conducted focus groups with 13 participants to identify approaches to visualizing personalized blood glucose forecasts that can promote diabetes self-management and understand key styles and visual features that resonate with individuals with diabetes. Focus groups demonstrated that individuals rely on simple heuristics and tend to take a reactive approach to their health and nutrition management. Further, the study highlighted the need for simple and explicit, yet information-rich design. Effective visualizations were found to utilize common metaphors alongside words, numbers, and colors to convey a sense of authority and encourage action and learning.",Pooja M. Desai;Matthew E.

In this paper we use data gathered from Twitter to examine which topics matter to players and to identify influential members of a game's community. By triangulating in-game data with Twitter activity we explore how tweets can provide contextual information for understanding fluctuations in in-game activity. To facilitate analysis of the data we introduce a visual data exploration tool and use it to analyze tweets related to the game Destiny. In total, we collected over one million tweets from about 250,000 users over a 14-month period and gameplay data from roughly 3,500 players over a six-month period.",Christian Drescher;Guenter Wallner;Simone Kriglstein;Rafet Sifa;Anders Drachen;Margit Pohl,,,
CHI,2018,Visualizing API Usage Examples at Scale,10.1145/3173574.3174154,"Using existing APIs properly is a key challenge in programming, given that libraries and APIs are increasing in number and complexity. Programmers often search for online code examples in Q&A forums and read tutorials and blog posts to learn how to use a given API. However, there are often a massive number of related code examples and it is difficult for a user to understand the commonalities and variances among them, while being able to drill down to concrete details. We introduce an interactive visualization for exploring a large collection of code examples mined from open-source repositories at scale. This visualization summarizes hundreds of code examples in one synthetic code skeleton with statistical distributions for canonicalized statements and structures enclosing an API call. We implemented this interactive visualization for a set of Java APIs and found that, in a lab study, it helped users (1) answer significantly more API usage questions correctly and comprehensively and (2) explore how other programmers have used an unfamiliar API.",Elena L.

Geo-tagged social media data are useful resource for this task; however, the abundance of everyday language in them makes this task still challenging. To address such challenges, we present TopicOnTiles, a visual analytics system that can reveal information relevant to anomalous events in a multi-level tile-based map interface by using social media data. To this end, we adopt and improve a recently proposed topic modeling method that can extract spatio-temporally exclusive topics corresponding to a particular region and a time point. Furthermore, we utilize a tile-based map interface to efficiently handle large-scale data in parallel. Our user interface effectively highlights anomalous tiles using our novel glyph visualization that encodes the degree of anomaly computed by our exclusive topic modeling processes. To show the effectiveness of our system, we present several usage scenarios using real-world datasets as well as comprehensive user study results.",Minsuk Choi;Dear Sungbok Shin;Jinho Choi 0005;Scott Langevin;Christopher Bethune;Philippe Horne;Nathan Kronenfeld;Ramakrishnan Kannan;Barry L.

CHI,2018,Beagle: Automated Extraction and Interpretation of Visualizations from the Web,10.1145/3173574.3174168,"""How common is interactive visualization on the web?"" ""What is the most popular visualization design?"" ""How prevalent are pie charts really?"" These questions intimate the role of interactive visualization in the real (online) world. In this paper, we present our approach (and findings) to answering these questions. First, we introduce Beagle, which mines the web for SVG-based visualizations and automatically classifies them by type (i.e., bar, pie, etc.). With Beagle, we extract over 41,000 visualizations across five different tools and repositories, and classify them with 85% accuracy, across 24 visualization types. Given this visualization collection, we study usage across tools. We find that most visualizations fall under four types: bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, and geographic maps. Though controversial, pie charts are relatively rare for the visualization tools that were studied. Our findings also suggest that the total visualization types supported by a given tool could factor into its ease of use. However this effect appears to be mitigated by providing a variety of diverse expert visualization examples to users.",Leilani Battle;Peitong Duan;Zachery Miranda;Dana Mukusheva;Remco Chang;Michael Stonebraker,,,

We present c.light, a design tool that consists of a set of modules and a mobile application for visualizing the light in a physical world. It allows designers to easily fabricate both tangible and intangible properties of a light without a technical barrier. We analyzed how c.light contributes to the ideation process of light design through a workshop. The results showed that c.light largely expands designers' capability to manipulate intangible properties of light and, by doing so, it facilitates collaborative and inverted ideation process in early design stages. It is expected that the results of this study could enhance our understanding of how designers manipulate light in a physical world in early design stages and could be a good stepping stone for future tool development.",Kyeong-Ah Jeong;EunJin Kim;Taesu Kim;Hyeon-Jeong Suk,,,
CHI,2018,A Visual Interaction Framework for Dimensionality Reduction Based Data Exploration,10.1145/3173574.3174209,"Dimensionality reduction is a common method for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. However, reasoning dynamically about the results of a dimensionality reduction is difficult. Dimensionality-reduction algorithms use complex optimizations to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataset, but these new dimensions often lack a clear relation to the initial data dimensions, thus making them difficult to interpret. Here we propose a visual interaction framework to improve dimensionality-reduction based exploratory data analysis. We introduce two interaction techniques, forward projection and backward projection, for dynamically reasoning about dimensionally reduced data. We also contribute two visualization techniques, prolines and feasibility maps, to facilitate the effective use of the proposed interactions. We apply our framework to PCA and autoencoder-based dimensionality reductions. Through data-exploration examples, we demonstrate how our visual interactions can improve the use of dimensionality reduction in exploratory data analysis.",Marco Cavallo;Çagatay Demiralp,,,
CHI,2018,Considering Agency and Data Granularity in the Design of Visualization Tools,10.1145/3173574.3174212,"Previous research has identified trade-offs when it comes to designing visualization tools. While constructive ""bottom-up' tools promote a hands-on, user-driven design process that enables a deep understanding and control of the visual mapping, automated tools are more efficient and allow people to rapidly explore complex alternative designs, often at the cost of transparency. We investigate how to design visualization tools that support a user-driven, transparent design process while enabling efficiency and automation, through a series of design workshops that looked at how both visualization experts and novices approach this problem. Participants produced a variety of solutions that range from example-based approaches expanding constructive visualization to solutions in which the visualization tool infers solutions on behalf of the designer, e.g., based on data attributes. On a higher level, these findings highlight agency and granularity as dimensions that can guide the design of visualization tools in this space.",Gonzalo Gabriel Méndez;Miguel A.

CHI,2017,Understanding Concept Maps: A Closer Look at How People Organise Ideas,10.1145/3025453.3025977,"Research into creating visualisations that organise ideas into concise concept maps often focuses on implicit mathematical and statistical theories which are built around algorithmic efficacy or visual complexity. Although there are multiple techniques which attempt to mathematically optimise this multi-dimensional problem, it is still unknown how to create concept maps that are immediately understandable to people. In this paper, we present an in-depth qualitative study observing the behaviour and discussing the strategy used by non-expert participants to create, interact, update and communicate a concept map that represents a collection of research ideas. Our results show non-expert individuals create concept maps differently to visualisation algorithms. We found that our participants prioritised narrative, landmarks, abstraction, clarity, and simplicity. Finally, we derive design recommendations from our results which we hope will inspire future algorithms that automatically create more usable and compelling concept maps better suited to the natural behaviours and needs of users.",Stefano Padilla;Thomas S.

CHI,2017,"Bottom-up vs. Top-down: Trade-offs in Efficiency, Understanding, Freedom and Creativity with InfoVis Tools",10.1145/3025453.3025942,"The emergence of tools that support fast-and-easy visualization creation by non-experts has made the benefits of InfoVis widely accessible. Key features of these tools include attribute-level operations, automated mappings, and visualization templates. However, these features shield people from lower-level visualization design steps, such as the specific mapping of data points to visuals. In contrast, recent research promotes constructive visualization where individual data units and visuals are directly manipulated. We present a qualitative study comparing people's visualization processes using two visualization tools: one promoting a top-down approach to visualization construction (Tableau Desktop) and one implementing a bottom-up constructive visualization approach (iVoLVER). Our results show how the two approaches influence: 1) the visualization process, 2) decisions on the visualization design, 3) the feeling of control and authorship, and 4) the willingness to explore alternative designs. We discuss the complex trade-offs between the two approaches and outline considerations for designing better visualization tools.",Gonzalo Gabriel Méndez;Uta Hinrichs;Miguel A. Nacenta,,,
CHI,2017,What Happened in my Home?: An End-User Development Approach for Smart Home Data Visualization,10.1145/3025453.3025485,"Smart home systems change the way we experience the home. While there are established research fields within HCI for visualizing specific use cases of a smart home, studies targeting user demands on visualizations spanning across multiple use cases are rare. Especially, individual data-related demands pose a challenge for usable visualizations. To investigate potentials of an end-user development (EUD) approach for flexibly supporting such demands, we developed a smart home system featuring both pre-defined visualizations and a visualization creation tool. To evaluate our concept, we installed our prototype in 12 households as part of a Living Lab study. Results are based on three interview studies, a design workshop and system log data. We identified eight overarching interests in home data and show how participants used pre-defined visualizations to get an overview and the creation tool to not only address specific use cases but also to answer questions by creating temporary visualizations.",Nico Castelli;Corinna Ogonowski;Timo Jakobi;Martin Stein;Gunnar Stevens;Volker Wulf,,,
CHI,2017,PathViewer: Visualizing Pathways through Student Data,10.1145/3025453.3025819,"Analysis of student data is critical for improving education. In particular, educators need to understand what approaches their students are taking to solve a problem. However, identifying student strategies and discovering areas of confusion is difficult because an educator may not know what queries to ask or what patterns to look for in the data. In this paper, we present a visualization tool, PathViewer, to model the paths that students follow when solving a problem. PathViewer leverages ideas from flow diagrams and natural language processing to visualize the sequences of intermediate steps that students take. Using PathViewer, we analyzed how several students solved a Python assignment, discovering interesting and unexpected patterns. Our results suggest that PathViewer can allow educators to quickly identify areas of interest, drill down into specific areas, and identify student approaches to the problem as well as misconceptions they may have.",Yiting Wang;Walker M.

However, we lack standard tools or guidelines for audiovisual (AV) interaction design, particularly for live performance. We propose the AVUI (AudioVisual User Interface), where sound and image are used together in a cohesive way in the interface; and an enabling technology, the ofxAVUI toolkit. AVUI guidelines and ofxAVUI were developed in a three-stage process, together with AV producers: 1) participatory design activities; 2) prototype development; 3) encapsulation of prototype as a plug-in, evaluation, and roll out. Best practices identified include: reconfigurable interfaces and mappings; object-oriented packaging of AV and UI; diverse sound visualization; flexible media manipulation and management. The toolkit and a mobile app developed using it have been released as open-source. Guidelines and toolkit demonstrate the potential of AVUI and offer designers a convenient framework for AV interaction design.",Nuno N. Correia;Atau Tanaka,,,
CHI,2017,Empirical Analysis of the Subjective Impressions and Objective Measures of Domain Scientists' Visual Analytic Judgments,10.1145/3025453.3025882,"Scientists often use specific data analysis and presentation methods familiar within their domain. But does high familiarity drive better analytical judgment? This question is especially relevant when familiar methods themselves can have shortcomings: many visualizations used conventionally for scientific data analysis and presentation do not follow established best practices. This necessitates new methods that might be unfamiliar yet prove to be more effective. But there is little empirical understanding of the relationships between scientists' subjective impressions about familiar and unfamiliar visualizations and objective measures of their visual analytic judgments. To address this gap and to study these factors, we focus on visualizations used for comparison of climate model performance. We report on a comprehensive survey-based user study with 47 climate scientists and present an analysis of: i) relationships among scientists' familiarity, their perceived levels of comfort, confidence, accuracy, and objective measures of accuracy, and ii) relationships among domain experience, visualization familiarity, and post-study preference.",Aritra Dasgupta;Susannah Burrows;Kyungsik Han;Philip J.

Based on a survey of the architecture literature on model making and ten interviews with practicing architects, we describe the role of physical models as a tool for exploration and communication. From these observations, we identify trends in the use of physical models in architecture, which have the potential to inform the design of data physicalizations. We identify four functions of architectural modeling that can be directly adapted for use in the process of building rich data models. Finally, we discuss how the visualization community can apply observations from architecture to the design of new data physicalizations.",Carmen Hull;Wesley Willett,,,
CHI,2017,Designing Game-Based Myoelectric Prosthesis Training,10.1145/3025453.3025676,"A myoelectric prosthesis (myo) is a dexterous artificial limb controlled by muscle contractions. Learning to use a myo can be challenging, so extensive training is often required to use a myo prosthesis effectively. Signal visualizations and simple muscle-controlled games are currently used to help patients train their muscles, but are boring and frustrating. Furthermore, current training systems require expensive medical equipment and clinician oversight, restricting training to infrequent clinical visits. To address these limitations, we developed a new game that promotes fun and success, and shows the viability of a low-cost myoelectric input device. We adapted a user-centered design (UCD) process to receive feedback from patients, clinicians, and family members as we iteratively addressed challenges to improve our game. Through this work, we introduce a free and open myo training game, provide new information about the design of myo training games, and reflect on an adapted UCD process for the practical iterative development of therapeutic games.",Aaron Tabor;Scott Bateman;Erik J.

However, users' interactions with their internal representations, including their expectations about data, are also critical for a visualization to support learning. We present multiple graphically-based techniques for eliciting and incorporating a user's prior knowledge about data into visualization interaction. We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user's ability to recall and understand the data. We find that participants who are prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when participants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data.

As many charts do not explicitly include trend lines or related statistical summaries, viewers often visually estimate trends directly from a plot. How reliable are the inferences viewers draw when performing such regression by eye? Do particular visualization designs or data features bias trend perception? We present a series of crowdsourced experiments that assess the accuracy of trends estimated using regression by eye across a variety of bivariate visualizations, and examine potential sources of bias in these estimations. We find that viewers accurately estimate trends in many standard visualizations of bivariate data, but that both visual features (e.g., ""within-the-bar"" bias) and data features (e.g., the presence of outliers) can result in visual estimates that systematically diverge from standard least-squares regression models.",Michael Correll;Jeffrey Heer,,,

Our studies underline that node-link and matrix views are suited to different analysis tasks. For the combined view, our studies show that there is a perceptually complementary effect in terms of improved accuracy for some tasks, but that there is a cost in terms of longer completion time than the faster of the two techniques alone.

Specifically, we examine the control of gain factors in tangible 3D interactions using locally-coupled mobile devices. By focusing on pressure as a separate input channel we can adjust gain factors independently from other input modalities used in 3D navigation, in particular for the exploration of 3D visualisations. We present two experiments. First, we determined that people strongly preferred higher pressures to be mapped to higher gain factors. Using this mapping, we compared pressure with rate control, velocity control, and slider-based control in a second study. Our results show that pressure-based gain control allows people to be more precise in the same amount of time compared to established input modalities. Pressure-based control was also clearly preferred by our participants.

Graph nodes represent grammar-based chart specifications and edges rep- resent edits that transform one chart to another. We weight edges with an estimated cost of the difficulty of interpreting a target visualization given a source visualization. We con- tribute (1) a method for deriving transition costs via a partial ordering of edit operations and the solution of a resulting lin- ear program, and (2) a global weighting term that rewards consistency across transition subsequences. In a controlled experiment, subjects rated visualization sequences covering a taxonomy of common transition types. In all but one case, GraphScape's highest-ranked suggestion aligns with subjects' top-rated sequences.

CHI,2017,TouchPivot: Blending WIMP & Post-WIMP Interfaces for Data Exploration on Tablet Devices,10.1145/3025453.3025752,"Recent advancements in tablet technology pose a great opportunity for information visualization to expand its horizons beyond desktops. In this paper, we present TouchPivot, a novel interface that assists visual data exploration on tablet devices. With novices in mind, TouchPivot supports data transformations, such as pivoting and filtering, with simple pen and touch interactions, and facilitates understanding of the transformations through tight coupling between a data table and visualization. We bring in WIMP interfaces to TouchPivot, leveraging their familiarity and accessibility to novices. We report on a user study conducted to compare TouchPivot with two commercial interfaces, Tableau and Microsoft Excel's PivotTable. Our results show that novices not only answered data-driven questions faster, but also created a larger number of meaningful charts during freeform exploration with TouchPivot than others. Finally, we discuss the main hurdles novices encountered during our study and possible remedies for them.",Jaemin Jo;Sehi L'Yi;Bongshin Lee;Jinwook Seo,,,
CHI,2017,Supporting Community Health Workers in India through Voice- and Web-Based Feedback,10.1145/3025453.3025514,"Our research aims to support community health workers (CHWs) in low-resource settings by providing them with personalized information regarding their work. This information is delivered through a combination of voice- and web-based feedback that is derived from data already collected by CHWs. We describe the in situ participatory design approach used to create usable and appropriate feedback for low-literate CHWs and present usage data from a 12-month study with 71 CHWs in India. We show how the system supported and motivated CHWs, and how they used both the web- and voice-based systems, and each of the visualizations, for different reasons. We also show that the comparative feedback provided by the system introduced elements of competition that discouraged some CHWs while motivating others. Taken together, our findings suggest that providing personalized voice- and web-based feedback could be an effective way to support and motivate CHWs in low-resource settings.",Brian DeRenzi;Nicola Dell;Jeremy Wacksman;Scott Lee;Neal Lesh,,,
CHI,2017,"Trust, but Verify: Optimistic Visualizations of Approximate Queries for Exploring Big Data",10.1145/3025453.3025456,"Analysts need interactive speed for exploratory analysis, but big data systems are often slow. With sampling, data systems can produce approximate answers fast enough for exploratory visualization, at the cost of accuracy and trust. We propose optimistic visualization, which approaches these issues from a user experience perspective. This method lets analysts explore approximate results interactively, and provides a way to detect and recover from errors later. Pangloss implements these ideas. We discuss design issues raised by optimistic visualization systems. We test this concept with five expert visualizers in a laboratory study and three case studies at Microsoft. Analysts reported that they felt more confident in their results, and used optimistic visualization to check that their preliminary results were correct.",Dominik Moritz;Danyel Fisher;Bolin Ding;Chi Wang 0001,,,
CHI,2017,iSphere: Focus+Context Sphere Visualization for Interactive Large Graph Exploration,10.1145/3025453.3025628,"Interactive exploration plays a critical role in large graph visualization. Existing techniques, such as zoom-and-pan on a 2D plane and hyperbolic browser facilitate large graph exploration by showing both the details of a focal area and its surrounding context that guides the exploration process. However, existing techniques for large graph exploration are limited in either providing too little context or presenting graphs with too much distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel focus+context technique, iSphere, to address the limitation. iSphere maps a large graph onto a Riemann Sphere that better preserves graph structures and shows greater context information. We conduct extensive experiment studies on different graph exploration tasks under various conditions. The results show that iSphere performs the best in task completion time compared to the baseline techniques in link and path exploration tasks. This research also contributes to understanding large graph exploration on small screens.",Fan Du;Nan Cao 0001;Yu-Ru Lin;Panpan Xu;Hanghang Tong,,,
CHI,2017,Supporting Making Fixations and the Effect on Gaze Gesture Performance,10.1145/3025453.3025920,"Gaze gestures are deliberate patterns of eye movements that can be used to invoke commands. These are less reliant on accurate measurement and calibration than other gaze-based interaction techniques. These may be used with wearable displays fitted with eye tracking capability, or as part of an assistive technology. The visual stimuli in the information on the display that can act as fixation targets may or may not be sparse and will vary over time. The paper describes an experiment to investigate how the amount of information provided on a display to assist making fixations affects gaze gesture performance. The impact of providing visualization guides and small fixation targets on the time to complete gestures and error rates is presented. The number and durations of fixations made during gesture completion is used to explain differences in performance as a result of practice and direction of eye movement.",Howell O. Istance;Aulikki I.

However, in these systems, the emotional states of the users are often not communicated properly due to their remoteness from one another. In this paper, we investigate the effects of showing emotional states of one collaborator to the other during an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) gameplay experience. We created two collaborative immersive VR games that display the real-time heart-rate of one player to the other. The two different games elicited different emotions, one joyous and the other scary.

This is based on the Weiserian assumption that people will be inclined to distribute their work across multiple ``pads' if such are available. We observed that this is not the reality today, even when devices were in abundance. We present a study with 24 participants in 12 dyads completing a collaborative visualization task with up to six tablets. They could choose between three different visualization types to answer questions about economic data. Tasks were designed to afford simultaneous use of tablets, either with linked or independent views. We found that users typically utilized only one tablet per user.

CHI,2017,Has Instagram Fundamentally Altered the 'Family Snapshot'?,10.1145/3025453.3025928,"This paper considers how parents use the social media platform Instagram to facilitate the capture, curation and sharing of 'family snapshots'. Our work draws upon established cross-disciplinary literature relating to film photography and the composition of family albums in order to establish whether social media has changed the way parents visually present their families. We conducted a qualitative visual analysis of a sample of 4,000 photographs collected from Instagram using hashtags relating to children and parenting. We show that the style and composition of snapshots featuring children remains fundamentally unchanged and continues to be dominated by rather bland and idealised images of the happy family and the cute child. In addition, we find that the frequent taking and sharing of photographs via Instagram has inevitably resulted in a more mundane visual catalogue of daily life. We note a tension in the desire to use social media as a means to evidence good parenting, while trying to effectively manage the social identity of the child and finally, we note the reluctance of parents to use their own snapshots to portray family tension or disharmony, but their willingness to use externally generated content for this purpose.",Effie Le Moignan;Shaun W.

We gave crowdsource workers i) abstract information visualization tasks without any context, ii) tasks where we added semantics to the dataset, and iii) tasks with two types of backstory narratives: an analytic narrative and a decision-making narrative. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence that adding data semantics increases accuracy, and further found that our backstory narratives can even decrease accuracy. Adding dataset semantics can however increase attention and provide subjective benefits in terms of confidence, perceived easiness, task enjoyability and perceived usefulness of the visualization. Nevertheless, our backstory narratives did not appear to provide additional subjective benefits. These preliminary findings suggest that narratives may have complex and unanticipated effects, calling for more studies in this area.",Evanthia Dimara;Anastasia Bezerianos;Pierre Dragicevic,,,

CHI,2017,Where No One Has Gone Before: A Meta-Dataset of the World's Largest Fanfiction Repository,10.1145/3025453.3025720,"With its roots dating to popular television shows of the 1960s such as Star Trek, fanfiction has blossomed into an extremely widespread form of creative expression. The transition from printed zines to online fanfiction repositories has facilitated this growth in popularity, with millions of fans writing stories and adding daily to sites such as Archive Of Our Own, Fanfiction.net, FIMfiction.net, and many others. Enthusiasts are sharing their writing, reading stories written by others, and helping each other to grow as writers. Yet, this domain is often undervalued by society and understudied by researchers. To facilitate the study of this large but often marginalized community, we present a fully anonymized data release (via differential privacy) of the metadata from a large fanfiction site (to protect author privacy, story, profile, and review text is excluded, and only metadata is provided).

CHI,2017,Improving Communication Between Pair Programmers Using Shared Gaze Awareness,10.1145/3025453.3025573,"Remote collaboration can be more difficult than collocated collaboration for a number of reasons, including the inability to easily determine what your collaborator is looking at. This impedes a pair's ability to efficiently communicate about on-screen locations and makes synchronous coordination difficult. We designed a novel gaze visualization for remote pair programmers which shows where in the code their partner is currently looking, and changes color when they are looking at the same thing. Our design is unobtrusive, and transparently depicts the imprecision inherent in eye tracking technology. We evaluated our design with an experiment in which pair programmers worked remotely on code refactoring tasks. Our results show that with the visualization, pairs spent a greater proportion of their time concurrently looking at the same code locations. Pairs communicated using a larger ratio of implicit to explicit references, and were faster and more successful at responding to those references.",Sarah D'Angelo;Andrew Begel,,,
CHI,2016,I Know Where You Live: Inferring Details of People's Lives by Visualizing Publicly Shared Location Data,10.1145/2858036.2858272,"This research measures human performance in inferring the functional types (i.e., home, work, leisure and transport) of locations in geo-location data using different visual representations of the data (textual, static and animated visualizations) along with different amounts of data (1, 3 or 5 day(s)). We first collected real life geo-location data from tweets. We then asked the data owners to tag their location points, resulting in ground truth data. Using this dataset we conducted an empirical study involving 45 participants to analyze how accurately they could infer the functional location of the original data owners under different conditions, i.e., three data representations, three data densities and four location types. The study results indicate that while visual techniques perform better than textual ones, the functional locations of human activities can be inferred with a relatively high accuracy even using only textual representations and a low density of location points. Workplace was more easily inferred than home while transport was the functional location with the highest accuracy. Our results also showed that it was easier to infer functional locations from data exhibiting more stable and consistent mobility patterns, which are thus more vulnerable to privacy disclosures. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of privacy preservation and provide guidelines to users and companies to help preserve and safeguard people's privacy.",Ilaria Liccardi;Alfie Abdul-Rahman;Min Chen 0001,,,

In this paper, we build an unsupervised system to capture dominating user behaviors from clickstream data (traces of users' click events), and visualize the detected behaviors in an intuitive manner. Our system identifies ""clusters"" of similar users by partitioning a similarity graph (nodes are users; edges are weighted by clickstream similarity). The partitioning process leverages iterative feature pruning to capture the natural hierarchy within user clusters and produce intuitive features for visualizing and understanding captured user behaviors. For evaluation, we present case studies on two large-scale clickstream traces (142 million events) from real social networks. Our system effectively identifies previously unknown behaviors, e.g., dormant users, hostile chatters.

Tumblr, a large social networking and micro blogging platform, is a popular venue to share animated GIFs. Tumblr users follow blogs, generating a feed or posts, and choose to ""like' or to ""reblog' favored posts. In this paper, we use these actions as signals to analyze the engagement of over 3.9 million posts, and conclude that animated GIFs are significantly more engaging than other kinds of media. We follow this finding with deeper visual analysis of nearly 100k animated GIFs and pair our results with interviews with 13 Tumblr users to find out what makes animated GIFs engaging. We found that the animation, lack of sound, immediacy of consumption, low bandwidth and minimal time demands, the storytelling capabilities and utility for expressing emotions were significant factors in making GIFs the most engaging content on Tumblr. We also found that engaging GIFs contained faces and had higher motion energy, uniformity, resolution and frame rate.

We prototyped two proof-of-concept implementations of sparse peripheral displays: a virtual reality headset, dubbed SparseLightVR, and an augmented reality headset, called SparseLightAR. Using SparseLightVR, we conducted a user study to evaluate the utility of our implementation, and a second user study to assess different visualization schemes in the periphery and their effect on simulator sickness. Our findings show that sparse peripheral displays are useful in conveying peripheral information and improving situational awareness, are generally preferred, and can help reduce motion sickness in nausea-susceptible people.",Robert Xiao;Hrvoje Benko,,,

Growing popularity of wearable gaze trackers presents an opportunity to add gaze information on the egocentric video. We hypothesized three potential benefits of gaze-augmented egocentric video to support collaborative scenarios: support deictic referencing, enable grounding in communication, and enable better awareness of the collaborator's intentions. Previous research on using egocentric videos for real-world collaborative tasks has failed to show clear benefits of gaze point visualization. We designed a study, deconstructing a collaborative car navigation scenario, to specifically target the value of gaze-augmented video for intention prediction. Our results show that viewers of gaze-augmented video could predict the direction taken by a driver at a four-way intersection more accurately and more confidently than a viewer of the same video without the superimposed gaze point. Our study demonstrates that gaze augmentation can be useful and encourages further study in real-world collaborative scenarios.",Deepak Akkil;Poika Isokoski,,,

This paper investigates the work of mapmakers working on the response to the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. In comparison to prior events, we found significantly more collaboration and spatial data sharing took place between map producers working across humanitarian organizations and parts of the Nepal government. Collaboration between mapping practitioners was supported by a complex and emergent information infrastructure composed of social and technical elements, some of which were brought through experience with prior disaster events, and some which were shaped anew by the availability and acceptance of open data sources.

To access evaluation streamlining now common in visual design, we introduce proxy modalities as a way to crowdsource VT sensations by reliably communicating high-level features through a crowd-accessible channel. We investigate two proxy modalities to represent a high-fidelity tactor: a new VT visualization, and low-fidelity vibratory translations playable on commodity smartphones. We translated 10 high-fidelity vibrations into both modalities, and in two user studies found that both proxy modalities can communicate affective features, and are consistent when deployed remotely over Mechanical Turk.

CHI,2016,Chronicler: Interactive Exploration of Source Code History,10.1145/2858036.2858442,"Exploring source code history is an important task for software maintenance. Traditionally, source code history is navigated on the granularity of individual files. This is not fine-grained enough to support users in exploring the evolution of individual code elements. We suggest to consider the history of individual elements within the tree structure inherent to source code. A history graph created from these trees then enables new ways to explore events of interest defined by structural changes in the source code. We present Tree Flow, a visualization of these structural changes designed to enable users to choose the appropriate level of detail for the task at hand. In a user study, we show that both Chronicler and the history aware timeline, two prototype systems combining history graph navigation with a traditional source code view, outperform the more traditional history navigation on a file basis and users strongly prefer Chronicler for the exploration of source code.",Moritz Wittenhagen;Christian Cherek;Jan O.

To understand the potential of comics as a storytelling medium, we first created a variety of comics during a 3 month structured design process, involving domain experts from public education and neuroscience. This process led to the definition of 8 design factors for creating graph comics and propose design solutions for each. Results from a qualitative study suggest that a general audience is quickly able understand complex temporal changes through graph comics, provided with minimal textual annotations and no training.",Benjamin Bach;Natalie Kerracher;Kyle Wm.

CHI,2016,Look Before You Leap: Improving the Users' Ability to Detect Fraud in Electronic Marketplaces,10.1145/2858036.2858555,"Reputation systems in current electronic marketplaces can easily be manipulated by malicious sellers in order to appear more reputable than appropriate. We conducted a controlled experiment with 40 UK and 41 German participants on their ability to detect malicious behavior by means of an eBay-like feedback profile versus a novel interface involving an interactive visualization of reputation data. The results show that participants using the new interface could better detect and understand malicious behavior in three out of four attacks (the overall detection accuracy 77% in the new vs. 56% in the old interface). Moreover, with the new interface, only 7% of the users decided to buy from the malicious seller (the options being to buy from one of the available sellers or to abstain from buying), as opposed to 30% in the old interface condition.",Johannes Sänger;Norman Hänsch;Brian Glass;Zinaida Benenson;Robert Landwirth;M.

CHI,2016,"'A bit like British Weather, I suppose': Design and Evaluation of the Temperature Calendar",10.1145/2858036.2858367,"In this paper we present the design and evaluation of the Temperature Calendar -- a visualization of temperature variation within a workplace over the course of the past week. This highlights deviation from organizational temperature policy, and aims to bring staff ""into the loop"" of understanding and managing heating, and so reduce energy waste. The display was deployed for three weeks in five public libraries. Analysis of interaction logs, questionnaires and interviews shows that staff used the displays to understand heating in their buildings, and took action reflecting this new understanding. Bringing together our results, we discuss design implications for workplace displays, and an analysis of carbon emissions generated in constructing and operating our design. More in general, the findings helped us to reflect on the role of policy on energy consumption, and the potential for the HCI community to engage with its application, as well as its definition or modification.",Enrico Costanza;Ben Bedwell;Michael O.

CHI,2016,iVoLVER: Interactive Visual Language for Visualization Extraction and Reconstruction,10.1145/2858036.2858435,"We present the design and implementation of iVoLVER, a tool that allows users to create visualizations without textual programming. iVoLVER is designed to enable flexible acquisition of many types of data (text, colors, shapes, quantities, dates) from multiple source types (bitmap charts, webpages, photographs, SVGs, CSV files) and, within the same canvas, supports transformation of that data through simple widgets to construct interactive animated visuals. Aside from the tool, which is web-based and designed for pen and touch, we contribute the design of the interactive visual language and widgets for extraction, transformation, and representation of data. We demonstrate the flexibility and expressive power of the tool through a set of scenarios, and discuss some of the challenges encountered and how the tool fits within the current infovis tool landscape.",Gonzalo Gabriel Méndez;Miguel A.

CHI,2016,Investigating Effects of Post-Selection Feedback for Acquiring Ultra-Small Targets on Touchscreen,10.1145/2858036.2858593,"In this paper, we investigate the effects of post-selection feedback for acquiring ultra-small (2-4mm) targets on touchscreens. Post-selection feedback shows the contact point on touchscreen after a user lifts his/her fingers to increase users' awareness of touching. Three experiments are conducted progressively using a single crosshair target, two reciprocally acquired targets and 2D random targets. Results show that in average post-selection feedback can reduce touch error rates by 78.4%, with a compromise of target acquisition time no more than 10%. In addition, we investigate participants' adjustment behavior based on correlation between successive trials. We conclude that the benefit of post-selection feedback is the outcome of both improved understanding about finger/point mapping and the dynamic adjustment of finger movement enabled by the visualization of the touch point.",Chun Yu;Hongyi Wen;Wei Xiong;Xiaojun Bi 0001;Yuanchun Shi,,,
CHI,2016,AniSAM & AniAvatar: Animated Visualizations of Affective States,10.1145/2858036.2858365,"Tools that provide visual feedback about emotions to the user in the form of an avatar or an emoticon have become increasingly important. While a great deal of effort has already been put into the reliable and accurate automatic detection of emotions, only very little is known about how this information about affective states should be displayed in a comprehensible way to the user. In the present study, three newly developed feedback tools were evaluated. The tools were developed on the basis of an existing non-verbal questionnaire to represent two dimensions of emotion (i.e. valence and arousal) based on the circumplex model of affect. A total number of 826 participants were tested, using different vignettes that describe situations with specific affective content. Employing three newly developed affective feedback tools (AniSAM, AniAvatar and MergedSAM), the ratings obtained were compared to ratings using the original SAM instrument, a well-established questionnaire to measure affect. Results indicated that the animated feedback increased the accuracy of the arousal representation. Furthermore, valence feedback was more accurate when provided with an animated manikin-based tool rather than an avatar-based tool. This provided first evidence for the usefulness of animated tools offering visual feedback on user emotion. All instruments need to undergo further development. AniSAM and AniAvatar can be downloaded for purposes of practical applications and further research.",Andreas Sonderegger;Klaus Heyden;Alain Chavaillaz;Jürgen S. Sauer,,,

The proposed tool triangulates users' gaze data with inferred users' cognitive and emotional states to produce user experience (UX) heatmaps, which show where users were looking when they experienced specific cognitive and emotional states. Results show that for a given cognitive state (i.e., cognitive load), the proposed UX heatmap was able to effectively highlight the areas where users experienced different levels of cognitive load on an interface. The proposed tool enables the visual analysis of users' various emotional and cognitive states for specific areas on a given interface, and also to compare users' states across multiple interfaces, which should be useful for both UX researchers and practitioners.",Vanessa Georges;François Courtemanche;Sylvain Senecal;Thierry Baccino;Marc Fredette;Pierre-Majorique Léger,,,
CHI,2016,Egocentric Analysis of Dynamic Networks with EgoLines,10.1145/2858036.2858488,"The egocentric analysis of dynamic networks focuses on discovering the temporal patterns of a subnetwork around a specific central actor (i.e., an ego-network). These types of analyses are useful in many application domains, such as social science and business intelligence, providing insights about how the central actor interacts with the outside world. We present EgoLines, an interactive visualization to support the egocentric analysis of dynamic networks. Using a ""subway map"" metaphor, a user can trace an individual actor over the evolution of the ego-network. The design of EgoLines is grounded in a set of key analytical questions pertinent to egocentric analysis, derived from our interviews with three domain experts and general network analysis tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EgoLines in egocentric analysis tasks through a controlled experiment with 18 participants and a use-case developed with a domain expert.",Jian Zhao 0010;Michael Glueck;Fanny Chevalier;Yanhong Wu;Azam Khan,,,

We have developed a university system, ResViz, which publicly visualizes the externally funded research projects of academics, and their internal collaborations. We present an interview study that engages 20 key stakeholders, academics and administrators who are part of the pilot release for the first version of this system. In doing so, we describe and problematize our design space, considering the implications of making metrics visible and their social use within a large organization.

Instead of a standard design critique, an alternative is to ask potential readers of the chart to answer questions about it. A controlled study with 47 participants shows a good correlation between aggregated novice heuristic evaluation scores and results of answering questions about the data, suggesting that the two forms of assessment can be complementary. Using both metrics in parallel can yield further benefits; discrepancies between them may reveal incorrect application of heuristics or other issues.",Marti A. Hearst;Paul Laskowski;Luis Silva,,,

The visualizations present the group's performance either in a more cooperative or more competitive way. Decades of research suggest that cooperation leads to greater productivity than competition. However, most of the existing group mirror visualizations achieve an increase in productivity and better self-regulation by enabling a direct comparison of performance within the group. We conducted a repeated measures study with 12 groups that were supported by visualizations that displayed the number of ideas of a brainstorming session (1) per person (competitive condition) (2) per group (cooperative condition), (3) per person and per group (mixed condition) and (4) without visualization (baseline).

Syntax highlighting is the main visual lens through which developers perceive their code, and yet its effects and the effects of richer code presentations on code comprehension have not been evaluated systematically. We present a rigorous user study comparing mainstream syntax highlighting to two visually-enhanced presentations of code. Our results show that: (1) richer code visualizations reduce the time necessary to answer questions about code features, and (2) contrary to the subjective perception of developers, richer code visualizations do not lead to visual overload.

Existing uncertainty visualizations may not align with user needs or how they naturally reason about probability. We present a novel mobile interface design and visualization of uncertainty for transit predictions on mobile phones based on discrete outcomes. To develop it, we identified domain specific design requirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction through: 1) a literature review, 2) a large survey of users of a popular realtime transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context, and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by ~1.15 times compared to density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context of realtime transit prediction scenarios.",Matthew Kay 0001;Tara Kola;Jessica R.

For example, a POI may exist outside the map or on a background with no meaningful cues. To address this issue, we present Personalized Compass, a self-contained compact graphical location indicator. Personalized Compass uses personal a priori POIs to establish a reference frame, within which a POI in question can then be localized. Graphically, a personalized compass combines a multi-needle compass with an abstract overview map. We analyze the characteristics of Personalized Compass and the existing Wedge technique, and report on a user study comparing them. Personalized Compass performs better for four inference tasks, while Wedge is better for a locating task. Based on our analysis and study results, we suggest the two techniques are complementary and offer design recommendations.",Daniel Miau;Steven Feiner,,,

We track the collaborator's points of gaze on a monitor screen displaying a physical workspace and visualize them onto the space by a projector or through an optical see-through head-mounted display. Through a series of user studies, we have found the followings: 1) Eye fixations can serve as a fast and precise pointer to objects of the collaborator's interest. 2) Eyes and other modalities, such as hand gestures and speech, are used differently for object identification and manipulation. 3) Eyes are used for explicit instructions only when they are combined with speech. 4) The worker can predict some intentions of the collaborator such as his/her current interest and next instruction.",Keita Higuchi;Ryo Yonetani;Yoichi Sato,,,

CHI,2016,Making Sense of Temporal Queries with Interactive Visualization,10.1145/2858036.2858408,"As real-time monitoring and analysis become increasingly important, researchers and developers turn to data stream management systems (DSMS's) for fast, efficient ways to pose temporal queries over their datasets. However, these systems are inherently complex, and even database experts find it difficult to understand the behavior of DSMS queries. To help analysts better understand these temporal queries, we developed StreamTrace, an interactive visualization tool that breaks down how a temporal query processes a given dataset, step-by-step. The design of StreamTrace is based on input from expert DSMS users; we evaluated the system with a lab study of programmers who were new to streaming queries. Results from the study demonstrate that StreamTrace can help users to verify that queries behave as expected and to isolate the regions of a query that may be causing unexpected results.",Leilani Battle;Danyel Fisher;Robert DeLine;Mike Barnett 0001;Badrish Chandramouli;Jonathan Goldstein,,,
CHI,2016,Investigating Time Series Visualisations to Improve the User Experience,10.1145/2858036.2858300,"Research on graphical perception of time series visualisations has focused on visual representation, and not on interaction. Even for visual representation, there has been limited study of the impact on users of visual encodings and the strengths and weaknesses of Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems. In order to address this research gap, we performed a comprehensive graphical perception study that measured the effectiveness of time series visualisations with different interactions, visual encodings and coordinate systems for several tasks. Our results show that, while positional and colour visual encodings were better for most tasks, area visual encoding performed better for data comparison. Most importantly, we identified that introducing interactivity within time series visualisations considerably enhances the user experience, without any loss of efficiency or accuracy. We believe that our findings can greatly improve the development of visual analytics tools using time series visualisations in a variety of domains.",Muhammad Adnan 0001;Mike Just;Lynne Baillie,,,

Implementing and reasoning about interactions that cover multiple devices with a diversity of form factors and capabilities can be complex. To assist developers in programming cross-device interactions, we created DemoScript, a technique that automatically analyzes a cross-device interaction program while it is being written. DemoScript visually illustrates the step-by-step execution of a selected portion or the entire program with a novel, automatically generated cross-device storyboard visualization. In addition to helping developers understand the behavior of the program, DemoScript also allows developers to revise their program by interactively manipulating the cross-device storyboard. We evaluated DemoScript with 8 professional programmers and found that DemoScript significantly improved development efficiency by helping developers interpret and manage cross-device interaction; it also encourages testing to think through the script in a development process.",Pei-Yu (Peggy) Chi;Yang Li 0058;Björn Hartmann,,,

Often the importance of a feature in a model is only a rough estimate condensed into one number. However, our research goes beyond these naïve estimates through the design and implementation of an interactive visual analytics system, Prospector. By providing interactive partial dependence diagnostics, data scientists can understand how features affect the prediction overall. In addition, our support for localized inspection allows data scientists to understand how and why specific datapoints are predicted as they are, as well as support for tweaking feature values and seeing how the prediction responds.

CHI,2016,Integrating the Smart Home into the Digital Calendar,10.1145/2858036.2858168,"With the growing adoption of smart home technologies, inhabitants are faced with the challenge of making sense of the data that their homes can collect to configure automated behaviors that benefit their routines. Current commercial smart home interfaces usually provide information on individual devices instead of a more comprehensive overview of a home's behavior. To reduce the complexity of smart home data and integrate it better into inhabitants' lives, we turned to the familiar metaphor of a calendar and developed our smart home interface Casalendar. In order to investigate the concept and evaluate our goals to facilitate the understanding of smart home data, we created a prototype that we installed in two commercial smart homes for a month. The results we present in this paper are based on our analysis of user data from questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, participant-driven audio and screenshot feedback as well as logged interactions with our system.

To investigate this design space, we developed eight high-level visual sound feedback dimensions. For each dimension, we created 3-12 example visualizations and evaluated these as a design probe with 24 deaf and hard of hearing participants (Study 1). We then implemented a real-time proof-of-concept HMD prototype and solicited feedback from 4 new participants (Study 2). Study 1 findings reaffirm past work on challenges faced by persons with hearing loss in group conversations, provide support for the general idea of sound awareness visualizations on HMDs, and reveal preferences for specific design options.

We investigate the effect of using square matrices and triangular matrices on the speed and accuracy of performing graphical-perception tasks. Based on human symmetric perception, we propose two alternative juxtaposition designs to the conventional side-by-side juxtaposition, and study how users perform visual search and comparison tasks regarding different juxtaposition types. Our results show that the matrix representations have similar performance, and the matrix juxtaposition types perform differently.

CHI,2015,Trajectory Bundling for Animated Transitions,10.1145/2702123.2702476,"Animated transition has been a popular design choice for smoothly switching between different visualization views or layouts, in which movement trajectories are created as cues for tracking objects during location shifting. Tracking moving objects, however, becomes difficult when their movement paths overlap or the number of tracking targets increases. We propose a novel design to facilitate tracking moving objects in animated transitions. Instead of simply animating an object along a straight line, we create ""bundled"" movement trajectories for a group of objects that have spatial proximity and share similar moving directions. To study the effect of bundled trajectories, we untangle variations due to different aspects of tracking complexity in a comprehensive controlled user study. The results indicate that using bundled trajectories is particularly effective when tracking more targets (six vs. three targets) or when the object movement involves a high degree of occlusion or deformation. Based on the study, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the new technique, as well as provide design implications.",Fan Du;Nan Cao 0001;Jian Zhao 0010;Yu-Ru Lin,,,

Specifically, we compared scene rotation around vertical axis to a full 3D rotation using a InterSense IS-900 3D controller, in a task involving trivariate trend detection in a 3D scatterplot. We found that, while 3D rotation leads to slower performance, previous exposure to single-axis rotation removes that difference.

CHI,2015,Stock Lamp: An Engagement-Versatile Visualization Design,10.1145/2702123.2702323,"Design methodologies for information visualizations are typically based on the assumption that the users will be fully engaged in the visual exploration of the displayed information. However, recent research suggests that there is an increasing diversity in how users engage with modern visualizations, and that the traditional design theories do not always satisfy the varied users needs. In this paper, we present a new design concept, engagement-versatile design, for visualizations that target users with a variety of engagement styles. Without losing generality, we demonstrate the feasibility of this concept through the designing of a system called Stock Lamp, an engagement-versatile visualization that helps users keep track of the stock market in real-time. This design process includes identifying different modes of engagement, deriving design implications from each engagement-mode, and applying them to the visualization's design. Our user study shows that Stock Lamp is able to consistently relay market information even when the users are multi-tasking. We believe this study establishes a new concept that promotes a systematic design approach that leverages both theoretical and empirical design methodologies for future visualization development.",Yuzuru Tanahashi;Kwan-Liu Ma,,,

Given the richness of personality data that can be derived today and the varied sensitivity of revealing such data, it is a non-trivial task for users to configure their privacy settings for sharing and protecting their derived personality data. Here we present the design, development, and evaluation of an interactive visualization tool, VeilMe, which helps users configure the privacy settings for the use of their personality portraits derived from social media. Unlike other privacy configuration tools, our tool offers two distinct advantages. First, it presents a novel and intuitive visual interface that aids users in understanding and exploring their own personality traits derived from their social media data, and configuring their privacy preferences. Second, our tool helps users to jump start their privacy settings by suggesting initial sharing strategies based on a set of factors, including the users' personality and target audience. We have evaluated the use of our tool with 124 participants in an enterprise context.

We describe our 15-month iterative design process including lessons learned through the development of three prototypes using participatory design and two evaluations of the final prototype: a design probe interview with seven elementary school teachers and three single-session deployments in after-school programs. Our findings have implications for the growing area of wearables and tangibles for learning.",Leyla Norooz;Matthew Louis Mauriello;Anita Jorgensen;Brenna McNally;Jon E. Froehlich,,,
CHI,2015,Patina Engraver: Visualizing Activity Logs as Patina in Fashionable Trackers,10.1145/2702123.2702213,"Despite technological improvements in commercial activity trackers, little attention has been given to their emotional, social, or fashion-related qualities, such as their visual aesthetics and their relationship to self-expression and social connection. As an alternative integrated approach incorporating HCI, fashion, and product design, our project made use of the characteristics of patina to improve activity trackers as fashionable wearables. We developed the Patina Engraving System, which engraves patina-like patterns on an activity tracker according to a user's activity logs. Using a piercing technique, the patina of activity logs has been made abstract, visually rich, gradually emerging, and historically accumulated. During the field trial, we found that the patina motivated the participants to increase exercises for engraving aesthetic patinas. A tracker with patina triggered spontaneous social interactions in face-to-face situations. The participants also cherished the trackers that held their own history. Based on the field trial, we discuss design implications for utilizing patina in designing future fashionable technologies.",Moon-Hwan Lee;Seijin Cha;Tek-Jin Nam,,,
CHI,2015,Infographic Aesthetics: Designing for the First Impression,10.1145/2702123.2702545,"Information graphics, or infographics, combine elements of data visualization with design and have become an increasingly popular means for disseminating data. While several studies have suggested that aesthetics in visualization and infographics relate to desirable outcomes like engagement and memorability, it remains unknown how quickly aesthetic impressions are formed, and what it is that makes an infographic appealing. We address these questions by analyzing 1,278 participants' ratings on appeal after seeing infographics for 500ms. Our results establish that: 1) people form a reliable first impression of the appeal of an infographic based on a mere exposure effect, 2) this first impression is largely based on colorfulness and visual complexity, and 3) age, gender, and education level influence the preferred level of colorfulness and complexity. More generally, these findings suggest that outcomes such as engagement and memorability might be determined much earlier than previously thought.",Lane Harrison;Katharina Reinecke;Remco Chang,,,

We conducted these experiments on a popular news and opinion outlet, and on a popular visualization gallery website. While data-journalism exposes visualizations to a large public, we do not know how effectively this public makes sense of interactive graphics, and in particular if people explore them to gain additional insight to that provided by the journalists. In contrast to our hypotheses, our results indicate that augmenting exploratory visualizations with introductory 'stories' does not seem to increase user-engagement in exploration.",Jeremy Boy;Françoise Détienne;Jean-Daniel Fekete,,,

However, very little is systematically recorded about (a) what elements are featured in data videos and (b) the processes used to create them. In this article, we provide initial insights to build this knowledge. We first report on a qualitative analysis of 50 professionally designed data videos, extracting and exposing their most salient constituents. Second, we report on a series of workshops with experienced storytellers from cinematography, graphics design and screenplay writing. We provided them with a set of data facts and visualizations and observed them create storyboards for data videos. From these exploratory studies, we derive broader implications for the design of an authoring tool to enable a wide audience to create data videos.

We start with an in-depth analysis of what deception means in the context of data visualization, and categorize deceptive visualizations based on the type of deception they lead to. We identify popular distortion techniques and the type of visualizations those distortions can be applied to, and formalize why deception occurs with those distortions. We create four deceptive visualizations using the selected distortion techniques, and run a crowdsourced user study to identify the deceptiveness of those visualizations. We then present the findings of our study and show how deceptive each of these visual distortion techniques are, and for what kind of questions the misinterpretation occurs. We also analyze individual differences among participants and present the effect of some of those variables on participants' responses. This paper presents a first step in empirically studying deceptive visualizations, and will pave the way for more research in this direction.",Anshul Vikram Pandey;Katharina Rall;Margaret L.

CHI,2015,STRATOS: Using Visualization to Support Decisions in Strategic Software Release Planning,10.1145/2702123.2702426,"Software is typically developed incrementally and released in stages. Planning these releases involves deciding which features of the system should be implemented for each release. This is a complex planning process involving numerous trade-offs-constraints and factors that often make decisions difficult. Since the success of a product depends on this plan, it is important to understand the trade-offs between different release plans in order to make an informed choice. We present STRATOS, a tool that simultaneously visualizes several software release plans. The visualization shows several attributes about each plan that are important to planners. Multiple plans are shown in a single layout to help planners find and understand the trade-offs between alternative plans. We evaluated our tool via a qualitative study and found that STRATOS enables a range of decision-making processes, helping participants decide on which plan is most optimal.",Bon Adriel Aseniero;Tiffany Wun;David Ledo;Guenther Ruhe;Anthony Tang 0001;Sheelagh Carpendale,,,
CHI,2015,Making Software Tutorial Video Responsive,10.1145/2702123.2702209,"Tutorial videos are widely available to help people use software. These videos, however, are viewed by users as captured and offer little direct interaction between users and software. This paper presents a video navigation method that allows users to interact with software tutorial video as if they were using the software. To make the tutorial video responsive, our method records the user interaction events like mouse click and drag during capturing the video. Our method then analyzes, selects, and visualizes these user interaction events at the event locations. When a user directly interacts with an event visualization, our method automatically navigates to the proper video frame to provide the visual feedback as if the software were responding to the user input. Thus, our method provides the experience of interacting with the software through directly manipulating the tutorial video. Our study shows our method can better help users follow tutorial videos to complete tasks than the baseline timeline interface.",Cuong Nguyen 0003;Feng Liu 0015,,,

There is a tradeoff between detail and abstraction in visualization, especially when the amount of content increases and becomes more difficult to process. We conducted an experiment on Mechanical Turk varying the quality, detail, and visual presentation of information about an individual's past work to see how these design features affected perceptions of the worker. We found that providing detail in the display through text increased processing time and led to less positive evaluations. Visually abstract displays required less processing time but decreased confidence in evaluation.

We describe a prototype that allows this to be used in real-time on a smartphone, but EnviroPulse could easily be incorporated into GPS systems, mapping services, or image-based systems. Our work differs from existing work in af-fective computing in that, rather than detecting a user's affect directly, we automatically determine the EAV of the environment through visual analysis. We present results that suggest our system can determine the EAV of envi-ronments. We also introduce real-time affective visual feedback of the calculated EAV of the images, and present results from an informal study suggesting that real-time visual feedback can be used for induction of affect.",Deltcho Valtchanov;Mark S.

CHI,2015,Designing Information for Remediating Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making,10.1145/2702123.2702239,"Software is playing an increasingly important role in supporting human decision-making. Previous HCI research on decision support systems (DSS) has improved the information visualization aspect of DSS information design, but has somewhat overlooked the cognitive aspect of decision-making, namely that human reasoning is heuristic and reflects systematic errors or cognitive biases. We report on an empirical study of two cognitive biases: conservatism and loss aversion. Two remediation techniques recommended by previous research were tested: the expected return method, an actuarial-inspired approach presenting objective metrics; and bootstrapping, a technique successful in improving judgment consistency. The results show that the two biases can occur simultaneously and can have a huge impact on decision-making. The results also show that the two debiasing techniques are only partly effective. These findings suggest a need for more research on debiasing, and indicate some directions for exploring debiasing techniques and building decision support systems.",Yunfeng Zhang;Rachel K. E.

Participants conducted an analysis task using a visual text-document analysis tool. We evaluated their memories of the process both immediately after the analysis and then again one week later. Results showed that even visual history views with reduced data-resolution were effective for aiding process memory. Further, even without inclusion of any data in the visual history aids, the visual cues alone from the final workspace were enough to improve memory of the main themes of analyses.",Eric D.

However, the effects of these displays on knowledge discovery in exploratory visual analysis are still poorly understood. We present the results of a small-scale study to better understand how display size and resolution affect insight. Analyzing participants' verbal statements, we find preliminary evidence that larger displays with more pixels can significantly increase the number of discoveries reported during visual exploration, while yielding broader, more integrative insights. Furthermore, we find important differences in how participants performed the same visual exploration task using displays of varying sizes.

By designing such palatable representations, our aim is to offer novel opportunities for reflection on one's physical activities. We present TastyBeats, a fountain-based interactive system that creates a fluidic spectacle of mixing sport drinks based on heart rate data of physical activity, which the user can later consume to replenish the loss of body fluids due to the physical activity. We articulate our experiences in designing the system as well as learning gained through field deployments of the system in participants' homes for a period of two weeks. We found that our system increased participants' awareness of physical activity and facilitated a shared social experience, while the prepared drink was treated as a hedonic reward that motivated participants to exercise more. Ultimately, with this work, we aim to inspire and guide design thinking on palatable representations, which we believe opens up new interaction possibilities to support physical activity experience.",Rohit Ashok Khot;Jeewon Lee;Deepti Aggarwal;Larissa Hjorth;Florian 'Floyd' Mueller,,,
CHI,2015,An Interactive System for Data Structure Development,10.1145/2702123.2702319,"Data structure algorithms are of fundamental importance in teaching and software development, yet are difficult to understand. We propose a new approach for understanding, debugging and developing heap manipulating data structures. The key technical idea of our work is to combine deep parametric abstraction techniques emerging from the area of static analysis with interactive abstraction manipulation. Our approach bridges program analysis with HCI and enables new capabilities not possible before: i) online automatic visualization of the data structure in a way which captures its essential operation, thus enabling powerful local reasoning, and ii) fine grained pen and touch gestures allowing for interactive control of the abstraction -- at any point the developer can pause the program, graphically interact with the data, and continue program execution. These features address some of the most pressing challenges in developing data structures. We implemented our approach in a Java-based system called FluiEdt and evaluated it with $27$ developers. The results indicate that FluiEdt is more effective in helping developers find data structure errors than existing state of the art IDEs (e.g. Eclipse) or pure visualization based approaches.",Jibin Ou;Martin T.

CHI,2015,An Evaluation of Interactive Map Comparison Techniques,10.1145/2702123.2702130,"Geovisualization applications typically organize data into layers. These layers hold different types of geographical features, describe different characteristics of the same features, or represent those features at different points in time. Layers can be composited in various ways, most often employing a juxtaposition or superimposition strategy, to produce maps that users can explore interactively. From an HCI perspective, one of the main challenges is to design interactive compositions that optimize the legibility of the resulting map and that ease layer comparison. We characterize five representative techniques, and empirically evaluate them using a set of real-world maps in which we purposefully introduce six types of differences amenable to inter-layer visual comparison. We discuss the merits of these techniques in terms of visual interference, user attention and scanning strategy.

To address this issue, we present ISSE - an interactive source separation editor. ISSE is a new open-source, freely available, and cross-platform audio editing tool that enables a user to perform source separation by painting on time-frequency visualizations of sound, resulting in an interactive machine learning system. The system brings to life our previously proposed interaction paradigm and separation algorithm that learns from user-feedback to perform separation.

CHI,2014,Automatic generation of semantic icon encodings for visualizations,10.1145/2556288.2557408,"Authors use icon encodings to indicate the semantics of categorical information in visualizations. The default icon libraries found in visualization tools often do not match the semantics of the data. Users often manually search for or create icons that are more semantically meaningful. This process can hinder the flow of visual analysis, especially when the amount of data is large, leading to a suboptimal user experience. We propose a technique for automatically generating semantically relevant icon encodings for categorical dimensions of data points. The algorithm employs natural language processing in order to find relevant imagery from the Internet. We evaluate our approach on Mechanical Turk by generating large libraries of icons using Tableau Public workbooks that represent real analytical effort by people out in the world.

CHI,2014,Task-driven evaluation of aggregation in time series visualization,10.1145/2556288.2557200,"Many visualization tasks require the viewer to make judgments about aggregate properties of data. Recent work has shown that viewers can perform such tasks effectively, for example to efficiently compare the maximums or means over ranges of data. However, this work also shows that such effectiveness depends on the designs of the displays. In this paper, we explore this relationship between aggregation task and visualization design to provide guidance on matching tasks with designs. We combine prior results from perceptual science and graphical perception to suggest a set of design variables that influence performance on various aggregate comparison tasks. We describe how choices in these variables can lead to designs that are matched to particular tasks. We use these variables to assess a set of eight different designs, predicting how they will support a set of six aggregate time series comparison tasks. A crowd-sourced evaluation confirms these predictions. These results not only provide evidence for how the specific visualizations support various tasks, but also suggest using the identified design variables as a tool for designing visualizations well suited for various types of tasks.",Danielle Albers;Michael Correll;Michael Gleicher,,,

This is because tasks that are simple on a traditional chart (e.g. ""compare two bars"") become a complex probabilistic task on a chart with uncertainty. We present guidelines for creating visual annotations for solving tasks with uncertainty, and an implementation that addresses five core tasks on a bar chart. A preliminary user study shows promising results: that users have a justified confidence in their answers with our system.",Nivan Ferreira;Danyel Fisher;Arnd Christian König,,,
CHI,2014,Visualizing dynamic networks with matrix cubes,10.1145/2556288.2557010,"Designing visualizations of dynamic networks is challenging, both because the data sets tend to be complex and because the tasks associated with them are often cognitively demand- ing. We introduce the Matrix Cube, a novel visual representation and navigation model for dynamic networks, inspired by the way people comprehend and manipulate physical cubes. Users can change their perspective on the data by rotating or decomposing the 3D cube. These manipulations can produce a range of different 2D visualizations that emphasize specific aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks. We describe Matrix Cubes and the interactions that can be performed on them in the Cubix system. We then show how two domain experts, an astronomer and a neurologist, used Cubix to explore and report on their own network data.",Benjamin Bach;Emmanuel Pietriga;Jean-Daniel Fekete,,,
CHI,2014,Kinetica: naturalistic multi-touch data visualization,10.1145/2556288.2557231,"Over the last several years there has been an explosion of powerful, affordable, multi-touch devices. This provides an outstanding opportunity for novel data visualization techniques that leverage new interaction methods and minimize their barriers to entry. In this paper we describe an approach for multivariate data visualization that uses physics-based affordances that are easy to intuit, constraints that are easy to apply and visualize, and a consistent view as data is manipulated in order to promote data exploration and interrogation. We provide a framework for exploring this problem space, and an example proof of concept system called Kinetica. We describe the results of a user study that suggest users of Kinetica were able to explore multiple dimensions of data at once, identify outliers, and discover trends with minimal training.",Jeffrey M.

CHI,2014,Traffigram: distortion for clarification via isochronal cartography,10.1145/2556288.2557224,"Most geographic maps visually represent physical distance; however, travel time can in some cases be more important than distance because it directly indicates availability. The technique of creating maps from temporal data is known as isochronal cartography, and is a form of distortion for clarification. In an isochronal map, congestion expands areas, while ideal travel conditions make the map shrink in comparison to the actual distance scale of a traditional map. Although there have been many applications of this technique, detailed user studies of its efficacy remain scarce, and there are conflicting views on its practical value. To attempt to settle this issue, we utilized a user-centered design process to determine which features of isochronal cartography might be most usable in practice. We developed an interactive cartographic visualization system, Traffigram, that features a novel combination of efficient isochronal map algorithms and an interface designed to give map users a quick and seamless experience while preserving geospatial integrity and aesthetics. We validated our design choices with multiple usability studies. We present our results and discuss implications for design.",Sungsoo (Ray) Hong;Yea-Seul Kim;Jong-Chul Yoon;Cecilia R. Aragon,,,
CHI,2014,Faces engage us: photos with faces attract more likes and comments on Instagram,10.1145/2556288.2557403,"Photos are becoming prominent means of communication online. Despite photos' pervasive presence in social media and online world, we know little about how people interact and engage with their content. Understanding how photo content might signify engagement, can impact both science and design, influencing production and distribution. One common type of photo content that is shared on social media, is the photos of people. From studies of offline behavior, we know that human faces are powerful channels of non-verbal communication. In this paper, we study this behavioral phenomena online. We ask how presence of a face, it's age and gender might impact social engagement on the photo. We use a corpus of 1 million Instagram images and organize our study around two social engagement feedback factors, likes and comments. Our results show that photos with faces are 38% more likely to receive likes and 32% more likely to receive comments, even after controlling for social network reach and activity. We find, however, that the number of faces, their age and gender do not have an effect. This work presents the first results on how photos with human faces relate to engagement on large scale image sharing communities. In addition to contributing to the research around online user behavior, our findings offer a new line of future work using visual analysis.",Saeideh Bakhshi;David A. Shamma;Eric Gilbert,,,

This paper presents the first reported ""coding"" of livecoding videos. From an identified corpus of videos available on the web, we coded performances of two different livecoding artists, recording both the (textual) programming edit events and the musical effect of these edits. Our analysis includes a novel, transition-matrix visualisation of the textual and musical dimensions of this data to create a ""performer fingerprint"".

CHI,2014,Visualization of personal history for video navigation,10.1145/2556288.2557106,"We present an investigation of two different visualizations of video history: Video Timeline and Video Tiles. Video Timeline extends the commonly employed list-based visualization for navigation history by applying size to indicate heuristics and occupying the full screen with a two-sided timeline. Video Tiles visualizes history items in a grid-based layout by following pre-defined templates based on items' heuristics and ordering, utilizing screen space more effectively at the expense of a clearer temporal location. The visualizations are compared against the state-of-the-art method (a filmstrip-based visualization), with ten participants tasked with sharing their previously-seen affective intervals. Our study shows that our visualizations are perceived as intuitive and both outperform and are strongly preferred to the current method. Based on these results, Video Timeline and Video Tiles provide an effective addition to video viewers to help manage the growing quantity of video. They provide users with insight into their navigation patterns, allowing them to quickly find previously-seen intervals, leading to efficient clip sharing, simpler authoring and video summarization.",Abir Al Hajri;Gregor Miller;Matthew Fong;Sidney S.

CHI,2014,Monadic exploration: seeing the whole through its parts,10.1145/2556288.2557083,"Monadic exploration is a new approach to interacting with relational information spaces that challenges the distinction between the whole and its parts. Building on the work of sociologists Gabriel Tarde and Bruno Latour we turn to the concept of the monad as a useful lens on online communities and collections that expands the possibility for creating meaning in their navigation. While existing interfaces tend to emphasize either the structure of the whole or details of a part, monadic exploration brings these opposing perspectives closer together in continuous movements between partially overlapping points of view. We present a visualization that reflects a given node's relative position within a network using radial displacements and visual folding. To investigate the potential of monadic exploration we report on an iterative design process of a web-based visualization of a highly cross-referenced book and its six-month deployment.",Marian Dörk;Rob Comber;Martyn Dade-Robertson,,,
CHI,2014,The role of interactive biclusters in sensemaking,10.1145/2556288.2557337,"Visual exploration of relationships within large, textual datasets is an important aid for human sensemaking. By understanding computed, structural relationships between entities of different types (e.g., people and locations), users can leverage domain expertise and intuition to determine the importance and relevance of these relationships for tasks, such as intelligence analysis. Biclusters are a potentially desirable method to facilitate this, because they reveal coordinated relationships that can represent meaningful relationships. Bixplorer, a visual analytics prototype, supports interactive exploration of textual datasets in a spatial workspace with biclusters. In this paper, we present results of a study that analyzes how users interact with biclusters to solve an intelligence analysis problem using Bixplorer. We found that biclusters played four principal roles in the analytical process: an effective starting point for analysis, a revealer of two levels of connections, an indicator of potentially important entities, and a useful label for clusters of organized information.",Maoyuan Sun;Lauren Bradel;Christopher L.

CHI,2014,DemoWiz: re-performing software demonstrations for a live presentation,10.1145/2556288.2557254,"Showing a live software demonstration during a talk can be engaging, but it is often not easy: presenters may struggle with (or worry about) unexpected software crashes and encounter issues such as mismatched screen resolutions or faulty network connectivity. Furthermore, it can be difficult to recall the steps to show while talking and operating the system all at the same time. An alternative is to present with pre-recorded screencast videos. It is, however, challenging to precisely match the narration to the video when using existing video players. We introduce DemoWiz, a video presentation system that provides an increased awareness of upcoming actions through glanceable visualizations. DemoWiz supports better control of timing by overlaying visual cues and enabling lightweight editing. A user study shows that our design significantly improves the presenters' perceived ease of narration and timing compared to a system without visualizations that was similar to a standard playback control. Furthermore, nine (out of ten) participants preferred DemoWiz over the standard playback control with the last expressing no preference.",Pei-Yu Chi;Bongshin Lee;Steven Mark Drucker,,,
CHI,2014,Structuring the space: a study on enriching node-link diagrams with visual references,10.1145/2556288.2557112,"Exploring large visualizations that do not fit in the screen raises orientation and navigation challenges. Structuring the space with additional visual references such as grids or contour lines provide spatial landmarks that may help viewers form a mental model of the space. However, previous studies report mixed results regarding their utility. While some evidence showed that grid and other visual embellishments improve memorability, experiments with contour lines suggest otherwise. In this work, we describe an evaluation framework to capture the impact of introducing visual references in node-link diagrams. We present the results of three controlled experiments that deepen our understanding on enriching large visualization spaces with visual structures. In particular, we provide the first tangible evidence that contour lines have significant benefits when navigating large node-link diagrams.",Basak Alper;Nathalie Henry Riche;Tobias Höllerer,,,

The layout of the comic is used to visualize this data as heat maps and explore patterns of users' recollections. We describe the theoretical justification for this based upon previous work in narrative visualizations, interactive stories and comics. Having tested the comic with school boys aged 11-12; we saw patterns in the data that complement other research in both interactive stories and visualizations. We argue that the heat maps helped identify these patterns, which have implications for future designs and analyses of interactive visual and/or narrative media.",Daniel Andrews;Chris Baber,,,

By displaying real-time information about how code actually behaves during execution, Theseus proactively addresses misconceptions by drawing attention to similarities and differences between the programmer's idea of what code does and what it actually does. To understand how programmers would respond to this kind of an always-on visualization, we ran a lab study with graduate students, and interviewed 9 professional programmers who were asked to use Theseus in their day-to-day work. We found that users quickly adopted strategies that are unique to always-on, real-time visualizations, and used the additional information to guide their navigation through their code.",Thomas Lieber;Joel R.

Smarties allows wall application developers to easily add interactive support to their collaborative applications. It consists of an interface running on touch mobile devices for input, a communication protocol between devices and the wall, and a library that implements the protocol and handles synchronization, locking and input conflicts. The library presents the input as an event loop with callback functions. Each touch mobile has multiple cursor controllers, each associated with keyboards, widgets and clipboards. These controllers can be assigned to specific tasks, are persistent in nature, and can be shared by multiple collaborating users for sharing work. They can control simple cursors on the wall application, or specific content (objects or groups of them). The types of associated widgets are decided by the wall application, making the mobile interface customizable by the wall application it connects to.",Olivier Chapuis;Anastasia Bezerianos;Stelios Frantzeskakis,,,

NewsViews' maps support trend identification and data comparisons relevant to a given news article. The NewsViews system leverages text mining to identify key concepts and locations discussed in articles (as well as potential annotations), an extensive repository of 'found' databases, and techniques adapted from cartography to identify and create visually 'interesting' thematic maps. In this work, we develop and evaluate key criteria in automatic, annotated, map generation and experimentally validate the key features for successful representations (e.g., relevance to context, variable selection, 'interestingness' of representation and annotation quality).",Tong Gao;Jessica Hullman;Eytan Adar;Brent J.

CHI,2014,"In-your-face, yet unseen?: improving head-stabilized warnings to reduce reaction time",10.1145/2556288.2557063,"One unique property of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is that content can easily be displayed at a fixed position within the user's field of view (head-stabilized). This ensures that critical information (e.g. warnings) is continuously visible and can, in principle, be perceived as quickly as possible. We examined this strategy with a physically and visually distracted driver. We ran two consecutive studies in a driving simulator, comparing different warning visualizations in a head-up display (HUD) and a HMD. In an initial study, we found no significant effects of warning type or display technology on the reaction times. In a second study, after modifying our visualization to include a visual reference marker, we found that with only this minor change, reaction times were significantly lower in the HMD when compared to the HUD. Our insights can help others design better head-stabilized notifications.",Felix Lauber;Andreas Butz,,,
CHI,2014,Show me the invisible: visualizing hidden content,10.1145/2556288.2557032,"Content on computer screens is often inaccessible to users because it is hidden, e.g., occluded by other windows, outside the viewport, or overlooked. In search tasks, the efficient retrieval of sought content is important. Current software, however, only provides limited support to visualize hidden occurrences and rarely supports search synchronization crossing application boundaries. To remedy this situation, we introduce two novel visualization methods to guide users to hidden content. Our first method generates awareness for occluded or out-of-viewport content using see-through visualization. For content that is either outside the screen's viewport or for data sources not opened at all, our second method shows off-screen indicators and an on-demand smart preview. To reduce the chances of overlooking content, we use visual links, i.e., visible edges, to connect the visible content or the visible representations of the hidden content. We show the validity of our methods in a user study, which demonstrates that our technique enables a faster localization of hidden content compared to traditional search functionality and thereby assists users in information retrieval tasks.",Thomas Geymayer;Markus Steinberger;Alexander Lex;Marc Streit;Dieter Schmalstieg,,,

CHI,2014,Crowdsourcing step-by-step information extraction to enhance existing how-to videos,10.1145/2556288.2556986,"Millions of learners today use how-to videos to master new skills in a variety of domains. But browsing such videos is often tedious and inefficient because video player interfaces are not optimized for the unique step-by-step structure of such videos. This research aims to improve the learning experience of existing how-to videos with step-by-step annotations. We first performed a formative study to verify that annotations are actually useful to learners. We created ToolScape, an interactive video player that displays step descriptions and intermediate result thumbnails in the video timeline. Learners in our study performed better and gained more self-efficacy using ToolScape versus a traditional video player. To add the needed step annotations to existing how-to videos at scale, we introduce a novel crowdsourcing workflow. It extracts step-by-step structure from an existing video, including step times, descriptions, and before and after images. We introduce the Find-Verify-Expand design pattern for temporal and visual annotation, which applies clustering, text processing, and visual analysis algorithms to merge crowd output. The workflow does not rely on domain-specific customization, works on top of existing videos, and recruits untrained crowd workers. We evaluated the workflow with Mechanical Turk, using 75 cooking, makeup, and Photoshop videos on YouTube. Results show that our workflow can extract steps with a quality comparable to that of trained annotators across all three domains with 77% precision and 81% recall.",Juho Kim;Phu Tran Nguyen;Sarah A.

Based on our observations of real uses of a wall display, this task represents a large category of applications. We report on a controlled experiment that uses this task to compare physical navigation in front of a wall-size display with virtual navigation using pan-and-zoom on the desktop. Our main finding is a robust interaction effect between display type and task difficulty: while the desktop can be faster than the wall for simple tasks, the wall gains a sizable advantage as the task becomes more difficult. A follow-up study shows that other desktop techniques (overview+detail, lens) do not perform better than pan-and-zoom and are therefore slower than the wall for difficult tasks.",Can Liu 0003;Olivier Chapuis;Michel Beaudouin-Lafon;Eric Lecolinet;Wendy E.

CHI,2013,The efficacy of human post-editing for language translation,10.1145/2470654.2470718,"Language translation is slow and expensive, so various forms of machine assistance have been devised. Automatic machine translation systems process text quickly and cheaply, but with quality far below that of skilled human translators. To bridge this quality gap, the translation industry has investigated post-editing, or the manual correction of machine output. We present the first rigorous, controlled analysis of post-editing and find that post-editing leads to reduced time and, surprisingly, improved quality for three diverse language pairs (English to Arabic, French, and German). Our statistical models and visualizations of experimental data indicate that some simple predictors (like source text part of speech counts) predict translation time, and that post-editing results in very different interaction patterns. From these results we distill implications for the design of new language translation interfaces.",Spence Green;Jeffrey Heer;Christopher D. Manning,,,
CHI,2013,Using fNIRS brain sensing to evaluate information visualization interfaces,10.1145/2470654.2470723,"We show how brain sensing can lend insight to the evaluation of visual interfaces and establish a role for fNIRS in visualization. Research suggests that the evaluation of visual design benefits by going beyond performance measures or questionnaires to measurements of the user's cognitive state. Unfortunately, objectively and unobtrusively monitoring the brain is difficult. While functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a practical brain sensing technology in HCI, visual tasks often rely on the brain's quick, massively parallel visual system, which may be inaccessible to this measurement. It is unknown whether fNIRS can distinguish differences in cognitive state that derive from visual design alone. In this paper, we use the classic comparison of bar graphs and pie charts to test the viability of fNIRS for measuring the impact of a visual design on the brain. Our results demonstrate that we can indeed measure this impact, and furthermore measurements indicate that there are not universal differences in bar graphs and pie charts.",Evan M. Peck;Beste F.

Based on an in-depth literature review and interviews with neuroscientists, we explore high-level brain connectivity analysis tasks that need to be supported by dedicated visual analysis tools. A significant example of such a task is the comparison of different connectivity data in the form of weighted graphs. Several approaches have been suggested for graph comparison within information visualization, but the comparison of weighted graphs has not been addressed. We explored the design space of applicable visual representations and present augmented adjacency matrix and node-link visualizations. To assess which representation best support weighted graph comparison tasks, we performed a controlled experiment. Our findings suggest that matrices support these tasks well, outperforming node-link diagrams. These results have significant implications for the design of brain connectivity analysis tools that require weighted graph comparisons.

CHI,2013,Direct manipulation video navigation in 3D,10.1145/2470654.2466150,"Direct Manipulation Video Navigation (DMVN) systems allow a user to navigate a video by dragging an object along its motion trajectory. These systems have been shown effective for space-centric video browsing. Their performance, however, is often limited by temporal ambiguities in a video with complex motion, such as recurring motion, self-intersecting motion, and pauses. The ambiguities come from reducing the 3D spatial-temporal motion (x, y, t) to the 2D spatial motion (x, y) in visualizing the motion and dragging the object. In this paper, we present a 3D DMVN system that maps the spatial-temporal motion (x, y, t) to 3D space (x, y, z) by mapping time t to depth z, visualizes the motion and video frame in 3D, and allows to navigate the video by spatial-temporally manipulating the object in 3D. We show that since our 3D DMVN system preserves all the motion information, it resolves the temporal ambiguities and supports intuitive navigation on challenging videos with complex motion.",Cuong Nguyen 0003;Yuzhen Niu;Feng Liu 0015,,,
CHI,2013,The dubuque electricity portal: evaluation of a city-scale residential electricity consumption feedback system,10.1145/2470654.2466155,"This paper describes the Dubuque Electricity Portal, a city-scale system aimed at supporting voluntary reductions of electricity consumption. The Portal provided each household with fine-grained feedback on its electricity use, as well as using incentives, comparisons, and goal setting to encourage conservation. Logs, a survey and interviews were used to evaluate the user experience of the Portal during a 20-week pilot with 765 volunteer households. Although the volunteers had already made a wide range of changes to conserve electricity prior to the pilot, those who used the Portal decreased their electricity use by about 3.7%. They also reported increased understanding of their usage, and reported taking an array of actions - both changing their behavior and their electricity infrastructure. The paper discusses the experience of the system's users, and describes challenges for the design of ECF systems, including balancing accessibility and security, a preference for time-based visualizations, and the advisability of multiple modes of feedback, incentives and information presentation.",Thomas Erickson;Ming Li 0009;Younghun Kim;Ajay Deshpande;Sambit Sahu;Tian Chao;Piyawadee Sukaviriya;Milind R.

CHI,2013,Exploring & designing tools to enhance falls rehabilitation in the home,10.1145/2470654.2466159,"Falls are the leading cause of accidental injury-related deaths in the elderly; a fall can lead to a loss of independence, and a fear of falling. Rehabilitation programmes involving exercise have proved the most successful way to reduce the risk of falls. However, the limitations of standard care (e.g. booklets) could prevent home users from receiving the full therapeutic benefit that rehabilitation offers. Having consulted users and health experts, we developed games, and visualizations for falls rehabilitation that we believe could potentially overcome the main barriers to effective rehabilitation in the home. In this paper, we describe user studies that we carried out with older adults to evaluate the use of these visual tools versus standard care, both in the laboratory and in the home. Our main findings show that our visualizations and games were able to overcome the major limitations of standard care, and that they were usable and acceptable to the end users.",Stephen Uzor;Lynne Baillie,,,

Currently, patients undergoing knee rehabilitation have limited ways of assessing exercise form and extent of movement at home. To address this issue, we developed an exploratory wearable electronic prototype to visualize knee bend.

CHI,2013,Talking about tactile experiences,10.1145/2470654.2466220,"A common problem with designing and developing applications with tactile interfaces is the lack of a vocabulary that allows one to describe or communicate about haptics. Here we present the findings from a study exploring participants' verbalizations of their tactile experiences across two modulated tactile stimuli (16Hz and 250Hz) related to two important mechanoreceptors in the human hand. The study, with 14 participants, applied the explicitation interview technique to capture detailed descriptions of the diachronic and synchronic structure of tactile experiences. We propose 14 categories for a human-experiential vocabulary based on the categorization of the findings and tie them back to neurophysiological and psychophysical data on the human hand. We finally discuss design opportunities created through this experiential understanding in relation to the two mechanoreceptors.",Marianna Obrist;Sue Ann Seah;Sriram Subramanian,,,

However, there is limited research that looks into the effects that sharing biometric data with others could have on one's social network. Following a period of research on existing mobile applications and prototype testing, we developed a system, HeartLink, which collects real-time personal biometric data such as heart rate and broadcasts this data online. Insights gained on designing systems to broadcast real-time biometric data are presented. In this paper we also report emerging results from testing HeartLink in a pilot study and a user study that were conducted during sport events. The results showed that sharing heart rate data does influence the relationship of the persons involved and that the degree of influence seems related to the tie strength prior to visualizing the data.",Franco Curmi;Maria Angela Ferrario;Jen Southern;Jon Whittle 0001,,,
CHI,2013,TouchViz: a case study comparing two interfaces for data analytics on tablets,10.1145/2470654.2481318,"As more applications move from the desktop to touch devices like tablets, designers must wrestle with the costs of porting a design with as little revision of the UI as possible from one device to the other, or of optimizing the interaction per device. We consider the tradeoffs between two versions of a UI for working with data on a touch tablet. One interface is based on using the conventional desktop metaphor (WIMP) with a control panel, push buttons, and checkboxes -- where the mouse click is effectively replaced by a finger tap. The other interface (which we call FLUID) eliminates the control panel and focuses touch actions on the data visualization itself. We describe our design process and evaluation of each interface. We discuss the significantly better task performance and preference for the FLUID interface, in particular how touch design may challenge certain assumptions about the performance benefits of WIMP interfaces that do not hold on touch devices, such as the superiority of gestural vs. control panel based interaction.",Steven Mark Drucker;Danyel Fisher;Ramik Sadana;Jessica Herron;m. c. schraefel,,,
CHI,2013,Evaluating the efficiency of physical visualizations,10.1145/2470654.2481359,"Data sculptures are an increasingly popular form of physical visualization whose purposes are essentially artistic, communicative or educational. But can physical visualizations help carry out actual information visualization tasks? We present the first infovis study comparing physical to on-screen visualizations. We focus on 3D visualizations, as these are common among physical visualizations but known to be problematic on computers. Taking 3D bar charts as an example, we show that moving visualizations to the physical world can improve users' efficiency at information retrieval tasks. In contrast, augmenting on-screen visualizations with stereoscopic rendering alone or with prop-based manipulation was of limited help. The efficiency of physical visualizations seems to stem from features that are unique to physical objects, such as their ability to be touched and their perfect visual realism. These findings provide empirical motivation for current research on fast digital fabrication and self-reconfiguring interfaces.",Yvonne Jansen;Pierre Dragicevic;Jean-Daniel Fekete,,,

In this work we look at the ability of viewers to make judgments about the relative quantities of tags in annotated text (specifically text tagged with one of a set of qualitatively distinct colors), and examine design choices that can improve performance at extracting statistical information from these texts. We find that viewers can efficiently and accurately estimate the proportions of tag levels over a range of situations; however accuracy can be improved through color choice and area adjustments.",Michael Correll;Eric C.

While textual tools have dominated these developments, annotated information visualizations are a promising way to complement articles based on their ability to add context. But the manual effort required for professional designers to create thoughtful annotations for contextualizing news visualizations is difficult to scale. We describe the design of Contextifier, a novel system that automatically produces custom, annotated visualizations of stock behavior given a news article about a company. Contextifier's algorithms for choosing annotations is informed by a study of professionally created visualizations and takes into account visual salience, contextual relevance, and a detection of key events in the company's history. In evaluating our system we find that Contextifier better balances graphical salience and relevance than the baseline.",Jessica Hullman;Nicholas Diakopoulos;Eytan Adar,,,

In addition to stable personality traits, research in psychology has found that temporary changes in affect (emotion) can also significantly impact performance during cognitive tasks. In this paper, we show that affective priming also influences user performance on visual judgment tasks through an experiment that combines affective priming with longstanding graphical perception experiments. Our results suggest that affective priming can influence accuracy in common graphical perception tasks. We discuss possible explanations for these findings, and describe how these findings can be applied to design visualizations that are less (or more) susceptible to error in common visualization contexts.",Lane Harrison;Drew Skau;Steven Franconeri;Aidong Lu;Remco Chang,,,

Dynamic data introduce challenges for these interfaces, however, as moving objects may exit the detail view, as well as a person's field of view if they are working at a large interactive surface. To address this ""off-view"" problem, we propose a new information visualization technique, called Canyon. This technique attaches a small view of an off-view object, including some surrounding context, to the external boundary of the detail view. The area between the detail view and the region containing the off-view object is virtually ""folded"" to conserve space. A comparison study was conducted contrasting the benefits and limitations of Canyon to an established technique, called Wedge. Canyon was more accurate across a number of tasks, especially more complex tasks, and was comparably efficient.",Alexandra Ion;Yu-Ling Betty Chang;Michael Haller;Mark S. Hancock;Stacey D. Scott,,,

In this note, we propose a quantitative measure called Binocular Selectability Discriminant (BSD) to predict the ability of the user to perform selection task in such a setup. In addition, we propose a technique called Binocular Cursor (BC) which takes advantage of this duplicating and overlapping phenomenon, rather than being hampered by it, to resolve binocular selection ambiguity by visualizing the correct selection point. An experiment shows that selection with BC is not slower than monocular selection, and that it can be significantly more precise, depending on the design of BC.",Joon Hyub Lee;Seok-Hyung Bae,,,
CHI,2013,Interactive horizon graphs: improving the compact visualization of multiple time series,10.1145/2470654.2466441,"Many approaches have been proposed for the visualization of multiple time series. Two prominent approaches are reduced line charts (RLC), which display small multiples for time series, and the more recent horizon graphs (HG). We propose to unify RLC and HG using a new technique - interactive horizon graphs (IHG) - which uses pan and zoom interaction to increase the number of time series that can be analysed in parallel. In a user study we compared RLC, HG, and IHG across several tasks and numbers of time series, focusing on datasets with both large scale and small scale variations. Our results show that IHG outperform the other two techniques in complex comparison and matching tasks where the number of charts is large. In the hardest task PHG have a significantly higher number of good answers (correctness) than HG (+14%) and RLC (+51%) and a lower error magnitude than HG (-64%) and RLC (-86%).",Charles Perin;Frédéric Vernier;Jean-Daniel Fekete,,,

Analyzing many time series at once is a common yet difficult task in many domains, for example in network monitoring. Several visualization techniques have, thus, been proposed in the literature. Among these, iconic displays or glyphs are an appropriate choice because of their expressiveness and effective use of screen space. Through a controlled experiment, we compare the performance of four glyphs that use different combinations of visual variables to encode two properties of temporal data: a) the position of a data point in time and b) the quantitative value of this data point. Our results show that depending on tasks and data density, the chosen glyphs performed differently. Line Glyphs are generally a good choice for peak and trend detection tasks but radial encodings are more effective for reading values at specific temporal locations. From our qualitative analysis we also contribute implications for designing temporal glyphs for small multiple settings.",Johannes Fuchs 0001;Fabian Fischer 0001;Florian Mansmann;Enrico Bertini;Petra Isenberg,,,
CHI,2013,"Motif simplification: improving network visualization readability with fan, connector, and clique glyphs",10.1145/2470654.2466444,"Analyzing networks involves understanding the complex relationships between entities, as well as any attributes they may have. The widely used node-link diagrams excel at this task, but many are difficult to extract meaning from because of the inherent complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem we introduce a technique called motif simplification, in which common patterns of nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor, connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes. We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector, and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates the effectiveness of motif simplification.",Cody Dunne;Ben Shneiderman,,,

However, their potential impact on informing and engaging citizens on relevant issues has still been largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that visualizations displayed in public settings are able to increase social awareness and discourse by exposing underlying patterns in data that is submitted by citizens. We thus introduce the design and evaluation of Reveal-it!, a public, interactive projection that facilitates the comparison of the energy consumptions of individuals and communities. Our in-the-wild deployment in three distinct physical locations provided insights into: 1) how people responded to this form of display in different contexts; 2) how it influenced people's perception and discussion of individual and communal data; and 3) the implications for a public visualization as a tool for increasing awareness and discourse.

Our proof-of-concept implementation consists of a single low-cost depth camera and projector and we present four novel interaction techniques that are focused on guiding a user's hand in mid-air. Our visualizations are designed to incorporate both feedback and feedforward cues to help guide users through a range of movements. We quantify the performance of LightGuide in a user study comparing each of our on-body visualizations to hand animation videos on a computer display in both time and accuracy.

CHI,2012,MirageTable: freehand interaction on a projected augmented reality tabletop,10.1145/2207676.2207704,"Instrumented with a single depth camera, a stereoscopic projector, and a curved screen, MirageTable is an interactive system designed to merge real and virtual worlds into a single spatially registered experience on top of a table. Our depth camera tracks the user's eyes and performs a real-time capture of both the shape and the appearance of any object placed in front of the camera (including user's body and hands). This real-time capture enables perspective stereoscopic 3D visualizations to a single user that account for deformations caused by physical objects on the table. In addition, the user can interact with virtual objects through physically-realistic freehand actions without any gloves, trackers, or instruments. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples: virtual 3D model creation, interactive gaming with real and virtual objects, and a 3D teleconferencing experience that not only presents a 3D view of a remote person, but also a seamless 3D shared task space. We also evaluated the user's perception of projected 3D objects in our system, which confirmed that the users can correctly perceive such objects even when they are projected over different background colors and geometries (e.g., gaps, drops).",Hrvoje Benko;Ricardo Jota;Andrew Wilson,,,

However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations - interpretation and trust - for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of ""word-borrowing"" that arose from an iterative design process.

CHI,2012,Semantic interaction for visual text analytics,10.1145/2207676.2207741,"Visual analytics emphasizes sensemaking of large, complex datasets through interactively exploring visualizations generated by statistical models. For example, dimensionality reduction methods use various similarity metrics to visualize textual document collections in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are approximately represented through their relative spatial distances to each other in a 2D layout. This metaphor is designed to mimic analysts' mental models of the document collection and support their analytic processes, such as clustering similar documents together. However, in current methods, users must interact with such visualizations using controls external to the visual metaphor, such as sliders, menus, or text fields, to directly control underlying model parameters that they do not understand and that do not relate to their analytic process occurring within the visual metaphor. In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, called semantic interaction, which seeks to enable analysts to spatially interact with such models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. Further, we demonstrate how semantic interactions can be implemented using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, called ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization. Analysts can express their expert domain knowledge about the documents by simply moving them, which guides the underlying model to improve the overall layout, taking the user's feedback into account.",Alex Endert;Patrick Fiaux;Chris North 0001,,,

We conducted an initial study to identify the set of attributes users attend to when comparing workflows, finding that they consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and the efficiency of the workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities: a high-level, clustered view; an intermediate-level list view that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate list view provided the best information density.

CHI,2012,A spatiotemporal visualization approach for the analysis of gameplay data,10.1145/2207676.2208558,"Contemporary video games are highly complex systems with many interacting variables. To make sure that a game provides a satisfying experience, a meaningful analysis of gameplay data is crucial, particularly because the quality of a game directly relates to the experience a user gains from playing it. Automatic instrumentation techniques are increasingly used to record data during playtests. However, the evaluation of the data requires strong analytical skills and experience. The visualization of such gameplay data is essentially an information visualization problem, where a large number of variables have to be displayed in a comprehensible way in order to be able to make global judgments. This paper presents a visualization tool to assist the analytical process. It visualizes the game space as a set of nodes which players visit over the course of a game and is also suitable to observe time-dependent information, such as player distribution. Our tool is not tailored to a specific type of genre. To show the flexibility of our approach we use two different kinds of games as case studies.",Günter Wallner;Simone Kriglstein,,,

CHI,2012,The case of the missed icon: change blindness on mobile devices,10.1145/2207676.2208606,"Insights into human visual attention have benefited many areas of computing, but perhaps most significantly visualisation and UI design [3]. With the proliferation of mobile devices capable of supporting significantly complex applications on small screens, demands on mobile UI design and the user's visual system are becoming greater. In this paper, we report results from an empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device, or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise. We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver information through visual changes or notifications.",Thomas Davies;Ashweeni Kumar Beeharee,,,
CHI,2012,The bohemian bookshelf: supporting serendipitous book discoveries through information visualization,10.1145/2207676.2208607,"Serendipity, a trigger of exciting yet unexpected discoveries, is an important but comparatively neglected factor in information seeking, research, and ideation. We suggest that serendipity can be facilitated through visualization. To explore this, we introduce the Bohemian Bookshelf, which aims to support serendipitous discoveries in the context of digital book collections. The Bohemian Bookshelf consists of five interlinked visualizations each offering a unique overview of the collection. It aims at encouraging serendipity by (1) offering multiple visual access points to the collection, (2) highlighting adjacencies between books, (3) providing flexible visual pathways for exploring the collection, (4) enticing curiosity through abstract, metaphorical, and visually distinct representations of books, and (5) enabling a playful approach to information exploration. A deployment at a library revealed that visitors embraced this approach of utilizing visualization to support open-ended explorations and serendipitous discoveries. This encourages future explorations into promoting serendipity through information visualization.",Alice Thudt;Uta Hinrichs;Sheelagh Carpendale,,,
CHI,2012,Supporting improvisation work in inter-organizational crisis management,10.1145/2207676.2208617,"Improvisation is necessary when planned decision-making as the main managerial activity does not fit the conditions the practice provides. In these cases, information technology should not just automate planned and structured decisions, but support improvisational practice. In this contribution we present an empirical study about the improvisation work in scenarios of medium to large power outages in Germany. Our focus is on inter-organizational cooperation practices, thus we examined the cooperation of fire departments, police, public administration, electricity infrastructure operators and citizens. Our empirical material allows to describe reasons and conditions for improvisation. Our resulting recommendations address the support of aggregation and visualization of information, a necessary individualization of information compositions, options for collaborative situation assessment, requirements for informal and formal communication, and accessibility of information resources.",Benedikt Ley;Volkmar Pipek;Christian Reuter 0001;Torben Wiedenhoefer,,,
CHI,2012,Annotating BI visualization dashboards: needs & challenges,10.1145/2207676.2208288,"Annotations have been identified as an important aid in analysis record-keeping and recently data discovery. In this paper we discuss the use of annotations on visualization dashboards, with a special focus on business intelligence (BI) analysis. In-depth interviews with experts lead to new annotation needs for multi-chart visualization systems, on which we based the design of a dashboard prototype that supports data and context aware annotations. We focus particularly on novel annotation aspects, such as multi-target annotations, annotation transparency across charts and data dimension levels, as well as annotation properties such as lifetime and validity. Moreover, our prototype is built on a data layer shared among different data-sources and BI applications, allowing cross application annotations. We discuss challenges in supporting context aware annotations in dashboards and other visualizations, such as dealing with changing annotated data, and provide design solutions. Finally we report reactions and recommendations from a different set of expert users.",Micheline Elias;Anastasia Bezerianos,,,
CHI,2012,Analysis within and between graphs: observed user strategies in immunobiology visualization,10.1145/2207676.2208291,"We present an analysis of two user strategies in interactive data analysis, based on an observational study of four researchers in the immunology domain. Screen captures, video records, interviews, and verbal protocols are used to analyze common procedures in this type of visual data analysis, as well as how these procedures differ among these users. Our findings present a case where skilled users can approach a similar problem with diverging analysis strategies. In the group we observed, strategies fell within two broad categories: within-graph analysis, in which a user generates a few graph layouts and interacts heavily within them, and between-graph analysis, in which a user generates a series of graphs and switches between them in sequence. Differences in strategies lead to distinct interaction patterns, and are likely to be best supported by different interface designs. We characterize these observed strategies and discuss their implications for scientific visualization design and evaluation.",Caroline Ziemkiewicz;Steven R. Gomez;David H. Laidlaw,,,

This can make creating novel, custom visualizations difficult for the average person. For example, existing tools typically do not support syntax or interaction techniques that are natural to end users. To explore how to support a more natural production of data visualizations by end users, we conducted an exploratory study to illuminate the structure and content of the language employed by end users when describing data visualizations.

CHI,2012,"GraphTrail: analyzing large multivariate, heterogeneous networks while supporting exploration history",10.1145/2207676.2208293,"Exploring large network datasets, such as scientific collaboration networks, is challenging because they often contain a large number of nodes and edges in several types and with multiple attributes. Analyses of such networks are often long and complex, and may require several sessions by multiple users. Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users' interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall.",Cody Dunne;Nathalie Henry Riche;Bongshin Lee;Ronald A.

Scale costs time. Such time also means that potential avenues of exploration are ignored because the costs are perceived to be too high to run or even propose them. With sampleAction we have explored whether interaction techniques to present query results running over only incremental samples can be presented as sufficiently trustworthy for analysts both to make closer to real time decisions about their queries and to be more exploratory in their questions of the data. Our work with three teams of analysts suggests that we can indeed accelerate and open up the query process with such incremental visualizations.,Danyel Fisher;Igor O.

Largely taken for granted in everyday interface design, the typographical component, through its legibility and aesthetics, weighs heavily on the ubiquitous reading task at the heart of most visualizations and interactions. In this paper, we present a research project whose goal is the creation of a new typeface to display textual information on future aircraft interfaces. After an initial task analysis leading to the definition of specific needs, requirements and design principles, the design constantly evolves from an iterative cycle of design and experimentation. We present three experiments (laboratory and cockpit) used mainly to validate initial choices and fine-tune font properties. Results confirm the importance of rigorously testing the typographical component as a part of text output evaluation in interactive systems.",Jean-Luc Vinot;Sylvie Athènes,,,
CHI,2012,Observational and experimental investigation of typing behaviour using virtual keyboards for mobile devices,10.1145/2207676.2208658,"With the rise of current smartphones, virtual keyboards for touchscreens became the dominant mobile text entry technique. We developed a typing game that records how users touch on the standard Android keyboard to investigate users' typing behaviour. 47,770,625 keystrokes from 72,945 installations have been collected by publishing the game. By visualizing the touch distribution we identified a systematic skew and derived a function that compensates this skew by shifting touch events. By updating the game we conduct an experiment that investigates the effect of shifting touch events, changing the keys' labels, and visualizing the touched position. Results based on 6,603,659 keystrokes and 13,013 installations show that visualizing the touched positions using a simple dot decreases the error rate of the Android keyboard by 18.3% but also decreases the speed by 5.2% with no positive effect on learnability. The Android keyboard outperforms the control condition but the constructed shift function further improves the performance by 2.2% and decreases the error rate by 9.1%. We argue that the shift function can improve existing keyboards at no costs.",Niels Henze;Enrico Rukzio;Susanne Boll,,,

In this paper we show that creation of a scripted or recorded video of an expert's think-aloud session augmented by an animation of their scanpaths can result in an effective aid for learners of visual search. Because the creation of such a video is relatively easy, the benefits-to-cost ratio may potentially be substantial, especially in settings where learned visual scanning strategies are indicators of expertise. We suggest that two such examples are examinations of Chest X-Rays and histological slides. Results are presented where straightforward construction of an instruction video provides measurable benefit to novice as well as experienced learners in the latter context.",Sarah A. Vitak;John E.

We introduce Apolo, a system that uses a mixed-initiative approach - combining visualization, rich user interaction and machine learning - to guide the user to incrementally and interactively explore large network data and make sense of it. Apolo engages the user in bottom-up sensemaking to gradually build up an understanding over time by starting small, rather than starting big and drilling down. Apolo also helps users find relevant information by specifying exemplars, and then using a machine learning method called Belief Propagation to infer which other nodes may be of interest. We evaluated Apolo with twelve participants in a between-subjects study, with the task being to find relevant new papers to update an existing survey paper. Using expert judges, participants using Apolo found significantly more relevant papers. Subjective feedback of Apolo was also very positive.",Duen Horng Chau;Aniket Kittur;Jason I.

CHI,2011,Twitinfo: aggregating and visualizing microblogs for event exploration,10.1145/1978942.1978975,"Microblogs are a tremendous repository of user-generated content about world events. However, for people trying to understand events by querying services like Twitter, a chronological log of posts makes it very difficult to get a detailed understanding of an event. In this paper, we present TwitInfo, a system for visualizing and summarizing events on Twitter. TwitInfo allows users to browse a large collection of tweets using a timeline-based display that highlights peaks of high tweet activity. A novel streaming algorithm automatically discovers these peaks and labels them meaningfully using text from the tweets. Users can drill down to subevents, and explore further via geolocation, sentiment, and popular URLs. We contribute a recall-normalized aggregate sentiment visualization to produce more honest sentiment overviews. An evaluation of the system revealed that users were able to reconstruct meaningful summaries of events in a small amount of time. An interview with a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist suggested that the system would be especially useful for understanding a long-running event and for identifying eyewitnesses. Quantitatively, our system can identify 80-100% of manually labeled peaks, facilitating a relatively complete view of each event studied.",Adam Marcus 0002;Michael S. Bernstein;Osama Badar;David R.

Using machine learning techniques, we classify each bill's sections based on existing document-level categories. We then visualize the resulting topic substructure of these bills. These visualizations provide an overview-and-detail view of bills, enabling users to read individual sections of a bill and compare topic patterns across multiple bills.

CHI,2011,Enhancing credibility judgment of web search results,10.1145/1978942.1979126,"In this paper, we propose a system for helping users to judge the credibility of Web search results and to search for credible Web pages. Conventional Web search engines present only titles, snippets, and URLs for users, which give few clues to judge the credibility of Web search results. Moreover, ranking algorithms of the conventional Web search engines are often based on relevance and popularity of Web pages. Towards credibility-oriented Web search, our proposed system provides users with the following three functions: (1) calculation and visualization of several scores of Web search results on the main credibility aspects, (2) prediction of user's credibility judgment model through user's credibility feedback for Web search results, and (3) re-ranking of Web search results based on user's predicted credibility model. Experimental results suggest that our system enables users - in particular, users with knowledge about search topics - to find credible Web pages from a list of Web search results more efficiently than conventional Web search interfaces.",Yusuke Yamamoto;Katsumi Tanaka,,,

CHI,2011,2d touching of 3d stereoscopic objects,10.1145/1978942.1979142,"Recent developments in the area of touch and display technologies have suggested to combine multi-touch systems and stereoscopic visualization. Stereoscopic perception requires each eye to see a slightly different perspective of the same scene, which results in two distinct projections on the display. Thus, if the user wants to select a 3D stereoscopic object in such a setup, the question arises where she would touch the 2D surface to indicate the selection. A user may apply different strategies, for instance touching the midpoint between the two projections, or touching one of them. In this paper we analyze the relation between the 3D positions of stereoscopically rendered objects and the on-surface touch points, where users touch the surface. We performed an experiment in which we determined the positions of the users' touches for objects, which were displayed with positive, negative or zero parallaxes. We found that users tend to touch between the projections for the two eyes with an offset towards the projection for the dominant eye. Our results give implications for the development of future touch-enabled interfaces, which support 3D stereoscopic visualization.",Dimitar Valkov;Frank Steinicke;Gerd Bruder;Klaus H. Hinrichs,,,

Participants navigated geographical maps to find specific locations, compare items, and follow routes. Results show that for multi-scale navigation, classic interactive visualization techniques did not benefit from being scaled to a large display: In contrast to the literature we find similar performance on medium and large displays.

CHI,2011,The impact of social information on visual judgments,10.1145/1978942.1979157,"Social visualization systems have emerged to support collective intelligence-driven analysis of a growing influx of open data. As with many other online systems, social signals (e.g., forums, polls) are commonly integrated to drive use. Unfortunately, the same social features that can provide rapid, high-accuracy analysis are coupled with the pitfalls of any social system. Through an experiment involving over 300 subjects, we address how social information signals (social proof) affect quantitative judgments in the context of graphical perception. We identify how unbiased social signals lead to fewer errors over non-social settings and conversely, how biased signals lead to more errors. We further reflect on how systematic bias nullifies certain collective intelligence benefits, and we provide evidence of the formation of information cascades. We describe how these findings can be applied to collaborative visualization systems to produce more accurate individual interpretations in social contexts.",Jessica Hullman;Eytan Adar;Priti Shah,,,

To enable richer interaction, we explore the design space of multi-touch document folding. We discuss several design considerations for simple modeless gesturing and compatibility with standard Drag and Pinch gestures. We categorize gesture models along the characteristics of Symmetric/Asymmetric and Serial/Parallel, which yields three gesture models. We built a prototype document workspace application that integrates folding and standard gestures, and a system for testing the gesture models.

We present CommentSpace, a collaborative system in which analysts comment on visualizations and websites and then use tags and links to organize findings and identify others'"" contributions. In a pair of studies comparing CommentSpace to a system without support for tags and links, we find that a small, fixed vocabulary of tags (question, hypothesis, to-do) and links (evidence-for, evidence-against) helps analysts more consistently and accurately classify evidence and establish common ground. We also find that managing and incentivizing participation is important for analysts to progress from exploratory analysis to deeper analytical tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that tags and links can help teams complete evidence gathering and synthesis tasks and that organizing comments using tags and links improves analytic results.",Wesley Willett;Jeffrey Heer;Joseph M.

CHI,2011,ReadN'Karaoke: visualizing prosody in children's books for expressive oral reading,10.1145/1978942.1979417,"We present a method for displaying prosody, the melody of speech, to aid beginning readers with fluent oral reading. We build on proven auditory techniques by manipulating and augmenting text in children's stories. The acoustic properties of a fluent recording are used to construct visualizations of pitch, loudness and length variations in read samples aligned with text. Our initial approach was to directly manipulate text, which was tested on ten children who showed significant increases in pitch modulation with manipulated text but reported difficulty with word recognition. This motivated designing the augmented text renderings, which display prosodic cues layered with text. Manipulated and augmented texts were compared with two beginning readers. Children showed similar prosodic gains with both versions and reported greater satisfaction with augmented pitch cues. Visual prosodic cues show promise for improving reading fluency in early readers and may have applications for disability education and second language learning.",Rupal Patel;William Furr,,,
CHI,2010,Crowdsourcing graphical perception: using mechanical turk to assess visualization design,10.1145/1753326.1753357,"Understanding perception is critical to effective visualization design. With its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it first requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon's Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.",Jeffrey Heer;Michael Bostock,,,
CHI,2010,ManyNets: an interface for multiple network analysis and visualization,10.1145/1753326.1753358,"Traditional network analysis tools support analysts in studying a single network. ManyNets offers these analysts a powerful new approach that enables them to work on multiple networks simultaneously. Several thousand networks can be presented as rows in a tabular visualization, and then inspected, sorted and filtered according to their attributes. The networks to be displayed can be obtained by subdivision of larger networks. Examples of meaningful subdivisions used by analysts include ego networks, community extraction, and time-based slices. Cell visualizations and interactive column overviews allow analysts to assess the distribution of attributes within particular sets of networks. Details, such as traditional node-link diagrams, are available on demand. We describe a case study analyzing a social network geared towards film recommendations by means of decomposition. A small usability study provides feedback on the use of the interface on a set of tasks issued from the case study.",Manuel Freire 0001;Catherine Plaisant;Ben Shneiderman;Jennifer Golbeck,,,
CHI,2010,A comparative evaluation on tree visualization methods for hierarchical structures with large fan-outs,10.1145/1753326.1753359,"Hierarchical structures with large fan-outs are hard to browse and understand. In the conventional node-link tree visualization, the screen quickly becomes overcrowded as users open nodes that have too many child nodes to fit in one screen. To address this problem, we propose two extensions to the conventional node-link tree visualization: a list view with a scrollbar and a multi-column interface. We compared them against the conventional tree visualization interface in a user study. Results show that users are able to browse and understand the tree structure faster with the multi-column interface than the other two interfaces. Overall, they also liked the multi-column better than others.",Hyunjoo Song;Bo Hyoung Kim;Bongshin Lee;Jinwook Seo,,,
CHI,2010,The case of the disappearing Ox: a field study of mobile activity and context logging,10.1145/1753326.1753397,"There are numerous settings where people examine, scrutinize and discuss the details of images in the course of their work. In most medical domains, scans and x-rays are used in the diagnosis of cases; in most areas of science, methods of visualization have been adopted to assist in the analysis of data; and images of different kinds are critical for many research fields in the social sciences and humanities. It is not surprising that recently technologies have been proposed to assist with the analysis and examination of images. In this paper, we consider requirements for technologies in a rather distinctive domain of research, the classics. Drawing upon an analysis of the detailed ways in which classicists work with digital images, we discuss the requirements for systems to support researchers in this domain, and also provide further considerations on the general development of image processing technologies and visualization techniques.",Grace de la Flor;Paul Luff;Marina Jirotka;John Pybus;Ruth Kirkham;Annamaria Carusi,,,
CHI,2010,Timeline collaboration,10.1145/1753326.1753404,"This paper explores timelines as a web-based tool for collaboration between citizens and municipal caseworkers. The paper takes its outset in a case study of planning and control of parental leave; a process that may involve surprisingly many actors. As part of the case study, a web-based timeline, CaseLine, was designed. This design crosses the boundaries between leisure and work, in ways that are different from what is often seen in current HCI. The timeline has several roles on these boundaries: It is a shared planning and visualization tool that may be used by parents and caseworkers alone or together, it serves as a contract and a sandbox, as a record and a plan, as inspiration for planning and an authoritative road, as a common information space and a fragmented exchange. Serving all these roles does not happen smoothly, and the paper discusses the challenges of such timeline interaction in, and beyond this case.",Morten Bohøj;Nikolaj Gandrup Borchorst;Niels Olof Bouvin;Susanne Bødker;Pär-Ola Zander,,,

CHI,2010,Apatite: a new interface for exploring APIs,10.1145/1753326.1753525,"We present Apatite, a new tool that aids users in learning and understanding a complex API by visualizing the common associations between its various components. Current object-oriented API documentation is usually navigated in a fixed tree structure, starting with a package and then filtering by a specific class. For large APIs, this scheme is overly restrictive, because it prevents users from locating a particular action without first knowing which class it belongs to. Apatite's design instead enables users to search across any level of an API's hierarchy. This is made possible by the introduction of a novel interaction technique that presents popular items from multiple categories simultaneously, determining their relevance by approximating the strength of their association using search engine data. The design of Apatite was refined through iterative usability testing, and it has been released publicly as a web application.",Daniel S. Eisenberg;Jeffrey Stylos;Brad A. Myers,,,
CHI,2010,Interactive optimization for steering machine classification,10.1145/1753326.1753529,"Interest has been growing within HCI on the use of machine learning and reasoning in applications to classify such hidden states as user intentions, based on observations. HCI researchers with these interests typically have little expertise in machine learning and often employ toolkits as relatively fixed ""black boxes"" for generating statistical classifiers. However, attempts to tailor the performance of classifiers to specific application requirements may require a more sophisticated understanding and custom-tailoring of methods. We present ManiMatrix, a system that provides controls and visualizations that enable system builders to refine the behavior of classification systems in an intuitive manner. With ManiMatrix, users directly refine parameters of a confusion matrix via an interactive cycle of re-classification and visualization. We present the core methods and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly and effectively modify decision boundaries of classifiers to tai-lor the behavior of classifiers to problems at hand.",Ashish Kapoor;Bongshin Lee;Desney S.

CHI,2010,pCubee: a perspective-corrected handheld cubic display,10.1145/1753326.1753535,"In this paper, we describe the design of a personal cubic display that offers novel interaction techniques for static and dynamic 3D content. We extended one-screen Fish Tank VR by arranging five small LCD panels into a box shape that is light and compact enough to be handheld. The display uses head-coupled perspective rendering and a real-time physics simulation engine to establish an interaction metaphor of having real objects inside a physical box that a user can hold and manipulate. We evaluated our prototype as a visualization tool and as an input device by comparing it with a conventional LCD display and mouse for a 3D tree-tracing task. We found that bimanual interaction with pCubee and a mouse offered the best performance and was most preferred by users. pCubee has potential in 3D visualization and interactive applications such as games, storytelling and education, as well as viewing 3D maps, medical and architectural data.",Ian Stavness;Billy Lam;Sidney S.

CHI,2010,Biketastic: sensing and mapping for better biking,10.1145/1753326.1753598,"Bicycling is an affordable, environmentally friendly alternative transportation mode to motorized travel. A common task performed by bikers is to find good routes in an area, where the quality of a route is based on safety, efficiency, and enjoyment. Finding routes involves trial and error as well as exchanging information between members of a bike community. Biketastic is a platform that enriches this experimentation and route sharing process making it both easier and more effective. Using a mobile phone application and online map visualization, bikers are able to document and share routes, ride statistics, sensed information to infer route roughness and noisiness, and media that documents ride experience. Biketastic was designed to ensure the link between information gathering, visualization, and bicycling practices. In this paper, we present architecture and algorithms for route data inferences and visualization. We evaluate the system based on feedback from bicyclists provided during a two-week pilot.",Sasank Reddy;Katie Shilton;Gleb Denisov;Christian Cenizal;Deborah Estrin;Mani B. Srivastava,,,
CHI,2010,UpStream: motivating water conservation with low-cost water flow sensing and persuasive displays,10.1145/1753326.1753604,"Water is our most precious and most rapidly declining natural resource. We explore pervasive technology as an approach for promoting water conservation in public and private spaces. We hope to motivate immediate reduction in water use as well as higher-order behaviors (seeking new information, etc) through unobtrusive low-cost water flow sensing and several persuasive displays. Early prototypes were installed at public faucets and a private (shared) shower, logging water usage first without and then with ambient displays. This pilot study led to design iterations, culminating in long-term deployment of sensors in four private showers over the course of three weeks. Sensors first logged baseline water usage without visualization. Then, two display styles, ambient and numeric, were deployed in random order, each showing individual and average water consumption. Quantitative data along with participants' feedback contrast the effectiveness of numeric displays against abstract visualization in this very important domain of water conservation and public health.",Stacey Kuznetsov;Eric Paulos,,,

Poor indoor air quality is difficult for humans to detect through sight and smell alone and can contribute to the development of chronic diseases. Through a four-week long study of fourteen households as six groups, we found that inAir (1) increased awareness of, and reflection on air quality, (2) promoted behavioral changes that resulted in improved indoor air quality, and (3) demonstrated the persuasive power of sharing for furthering improvements to indoor air quality in terms of fostering new social awareness and behavior changes as well as strengthening social bonds and prompting collaborative efforts across social networks to improve human health and well being.",Sunyoung Kim;Eric Paulos,,,
CHI,2010,Individual models of color differentiation to improve interpretability of information visualization,10.1145/1753326.1753715,"Color is commonly used to represent categories and values in many computer applications, but differentiating these colors can be difficult in many situations (e.g., for users with color vision deficiency (CVD), or in bright light). Current solutions to this problem can adapt colors based on standard simulations of CVD, but these models cover only a fraction of the ways in which color perception can vary. To improve the specificity and accuracy of these approaches, we have developed the first ever individualized model of color differentiation (ICD). The model is based on a short calibration performed by a particular user for a particular display, and so automatically covers all aspects of the user's ability to see and differentiate colors in an environment. In this paper we introduce the new model and the manner in which differentiability limits are predicted. We gathered empirical data from 16 users to assess the model's accuracy and robustness. We found that the model is highly effective at capturing individual differentiation abilities, works for users with and without CVD, can be tuned to balance accuracy and color availability, and can serve as the basis for improved color adaptation schemes.",David R.

CHI,2009,Visualizing real-time language-based feedback on teamwork behavior in computer-mediated groups,10.1145/1518701.1518784,"While most collaboration technologies are concerned with supporting particular tasks such as workflows or meetings, many work groups do not have the teamwork skills essential to effective collaboration. One way to improve teamwork is to provide dynamic feedback generated by automated analyses of behavior, such as language use. Such feedback can lead members to reflect on and subsequently improve their collaborative behavior, but might also distract from the task at hand. We have experimented with GroupMeter - a chat-based system that presents visual feedback on team members' language use. Feedback on proportion of agreement words and overall word count was presented using two different designs. When receiving feedback, teams in our study expressed more agreement in their conversations and reported greater focus on language use as compared to when not receiving feedback. This suggests that automated, real-time linguistic feedback can elicit behavioral changes, offering opportunities for future research.",Gilly Leshed;Diego Perez;Jeffrey T.

CHI,2009,What's next?: emergent storytelling from video collection,10.1145/1518701.1518825,"In the world of visual storytelling, narrative development relies on a particular temporal ordering of shots and sequences and scenes. Rarely is this ordering cast in stone. Rather, the particular ordering of a story reflects a myriad of interdependent decisions about the interplay of structure, narrative arc and character development. For storytellers, particularly those developing their narratives from large documentary archives, it would be helpful to have a visualization system partnered with them to present suggestions for the most compelling story path. We present Storied Navigation, a video editing system that helps authors compose a sequence of scenes that tell a story, by selecting from a corpus of annotated clips. The clips are annotated in unrestricted natural language. Authors can also type a story in unrestricted English, and the system finds possibilities for clips that best match high-level elements of the story. Beyond simple keyword matching, these elements can include the characters, emotions, themes, and story structure. Authors can also interactively replace existing scenes or predict the next scene to continue a story, based on these characteristics. Storied Navigation gives the author the feel of brainstorming about the story rather than simply editing the media.",Edward Yu-Te Shen;Henry Lieberman;Glorianna Davenport,,,

Several factors influence recognition rates including the nature of the gesture set and the suitability of the gesture recognition algorithm. This work explores how seamfulness in gesture stroke visualization affects recognition rates. We present the results of a user evaluation of a gesture recognition system that shows that raw (seamful) visualization of low-delity gesture stroke data has recognition rates comparable to no feedback. Providing filtered (seamless) stroke visualization to the user, while retaining the un-filtered input data for recognition, resulted in a 34.9% improvement in gesture recognition rate over raw stroke data. The results provide insights into the broader design space of seamful design, and identifies areas where seamlessness is advantageous.",Sven G. Kratz;Rafael Ballagas,,,

It extends the standard photo browsing paradigm in two main ways: visualizing spatial coverage of photos, and indexing photos by a combination of spatial coverage, time, and content specifications. This approach enables users to browse and search space- and time-indexed photos more effectively. We designed PhotoScope specifically to address challenges in the construction management industry, where large photo collections are amassed to document project progress. These ideas may also apply to any photo collection that is spatially constrained and must be searched using spatial, temporal, and content criteria.

While most researchers currently utilize an iterative approach to refining classifier models and performance, we propose that ensemble classification techniques may be a viable and even preferable alternative. In ensemble learning, algorithms combine multiple classifiers to build one that is superior to its components. In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study.

We compare line charts with horizon graphs - a space-efficient time series visualization technique - across a range of chart sizes, measuring the speed and accuracy of subjects' estimates of value differences between charts. We identify transition points at which reducing the chart height results in significantly differing drops in estimation accuracy across the compared chart types, and we find optimal positions in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve at which viewers performed quickly without attendant drops in accuracy.

CHI,2009,An intuitive model of perceptual grouping for HCI design,10.1145/1518701.1518903,"Understanding and exploiting the abilities of the human visual system is an important part of the design of usable user interfaces and information visualizations. Good design enables quick, easy and veridical perception of key components of that design. An important facet of human vision is its ability to seemingly effortlessly perform ""perceptual organization; it transforms individual feature estimates into perception of coherent regions, structures, and objects. We perceive regions grouped by proximity and feature similarity, grouping of curves by good continuation, and grouping of regions of coherent texture. In this paper, we discuss a simple model for a broad range of perceptual grouping phenomena. It takes as input an arbitrary image, and returns a structure describing the predicted visual organization of the image. We demonstrate that this model can capture aspects of traditional design rules, and predicts visual percepts in classic perceptual grouping displays.",Ruth Rosenholtz;Nathaniel R.

Overall, users who self-reported higher use of Internet information and higher rates of Wikipedia usage tended to produce lower credibility judgments about Wikipedia articles and authors. However, use of WikiDashboard significantly increased article and author credibility judgments, with effect sizes larger than any other measured effects of background media usage and attitudes on Wikiepedia credibility.

We present a field study of ten programmers who work with an editor extended with a fisheye view of source code. The study triangulates multiple methods (experience sampling, logging, thinking aloud, and interviews) to describe how the visualization is adopted and used. At the concrete level, our results suggest that the visualization was used as frequently as other tools in the programming environment.

CHI,2009,A user study on visualizing directed edges in graphs,10.1145/1518701.1519054,"Graphs are often visualized using node-link representations: vertices are depicted as dots, edges are depicted as (poly)lines connecting two vertices. A directed edge running from vertex A to B is generally visualized using an arrow representation: a (poly)line with a triangular arrowhead at vertex B. Although this representation is intuitive, it is not guaranteed that a user is able to determine edge direction as quickly and unambiguously as possible; alternative representations that exhibit less occlusion and visual clutter might be better suited. To investigate this, we developed five additional directed-edge representations using combinations of shape and color. We performed a user study in which subjects performed different tasks on a collection of graphs using these representations and combinations thereof to investigate which representation is best in terms of speed and accuracy. We present our initial hypotheses, the outcome of the user studies, and recommendations regarding directed-edge visualization.",Danny Holten;Jarke J. van Wijk,,,
CHI,2009,Topology-aware navigation in large networks,10.1145/1518701.1519056,"Applications supporting navigation in large networks are used every days by millions of people. They include road map navigators, flight route visualization systems, and network visualization systems using node-link diagrams. These applications currently provide generic interaction methods for navigation: pan-and-zoom and sometimes bird's eye views. This article explores the idea of exploiting the connection information provided by the network to help navigate these large spaces. We visually augment two traditional navigation methods, and develop two special-purpose techniques. The first new technique, called ""Link Sliding"", provides guided panning when continuously dragging along a visible link. The second technique, called ""Bring & Go"", brings adjacent nodes nearby when pointing to a node. We compare the performance of these techniques in both an adjacency exploration task and a node revisiting task. This comparison illustrates the various advantages of content-aware network navigation techniques. A significant speed advantage is found for the Bring & Go technique over other methods.",Tomer Moscovich;Fanny Chevalier;Nathalie Henry;Emmanuel Pietriga;Jean-Daniel Fekete,,,

Cheaper storage and easy access to recording devices allows extensive archival. However, as the size of the archive grows, retrieving the desired moments becomes increasingly difficult. We approach this problem from a socio-technical perspective and utilize human intuition aided by computer memory. We present computationally detected topics of conversation as visual summaries of discussion and as reference points into the archive. To further bootstrap the system, humans can participate in a dialog with the visualization of the clustering process and shape the development of clustering models.",Tony Bergstrom;Karrie Karahalios,,,

This paper presents the Handsaw, a system that detects a virtual cut-plane projected by an outstretched hand or laser-line directly on an object or space and reveals sectional data on an adjacent display. By leaving the hands free and using a remote display, these techniques can be shared between multiple users and integrated into everyday practice. The Handsaw has been prototyped for scientific visualizations in medicine, engineering and urban design. User evaluations suggest that using a hand is more intuitive while projected light is more precise than keyboard and mouse control, and the Handsaw system has the potential to be used effectively by novices and in groups.",Leonardo Bonanni;Jason Alonso;Neil Chao;Greg Vargas;Hiroshi Ishii 0001,,,

We propose that a tight integration of these technologies in an interactive exploratory tool could dramatically speed insight development. To test the power of this integrated approach, we created a novel social network analysis tool, SocialAction, and conducted four long-term case studies with domain experts, each working on unique data sets with unique problems. The structured replicated case studies show that the integrated approach in SocialAction led to significant discoveries by a political analyst, a bibliometrician, a healthcare consultant, and a counter-terrorism researcher. Our contributions demonstrate that the tight integration of statistics and visualizations improves exploratory data analysis, and that our evaluation methodology for long-term case studies captures the research strategies of data analysts.",Adam Perer;Ben Shneiderman,,,
CHI,2008,Your place or mine?: visualization as a community component,10.1145/1357054.1357102,"Many Eyes is a web site that provides collaborative visualization services, allowing users to upload data sets, visualize them, and comment on each other's visualizations. This paper describes a first interview-based study of Many Eyes users, which sheds light on user motivation for creating public visualizations. Users talked about data for many reasons, from scientific research to political advocacy to hobbies. One consistent theme across these different scenarios is the use of visualizations in communication and collaborative practices. Collaboration and conversation, however, often took place outside the site, leaving no traces on Many Eyes itself. In other words, despite spurring significant social activity, Many Eyes is not so much an online community as a ""community component"" which users insert into pre-existing online social systems.",Catalina M.

CHI,2008,ArtLinks: fostering social awareness and reflection in museums,10.1145/1357054.1357121,"Technologies in museums often support learning goals, providing information about exhibits. However, museum visitors also desire meaningful experiences and enjoy the social aspects of museum-going, values ignored by most museum technologies. We present ArtLinks, a visualization with three goals: helping visitors make connections to exhibits and other visitors by highlighting those visitors who share their thoughts; encouraging visitors' reflection on the social and liminal aspects of museum-going and their expectations of technology in museums; and doing this with transparency, aligning aesthetically pleasing elements of the design with the goals of connection and reflection. Deploying ArtLinks revealed that people have strong expectations of technology as an information appliance. Despite these expectations, people valued connections to other people, both for their own sake and as a way to support meaningful experience. We also found several of our design choices in the name of transparency led to unforeseen tradeoffs between the social and the liminal.",Dan Cosley;Joel Lewenstein;Andrew Herman;Jenna Holloway;Jonathan Baxter;Saeko Nomura;Kirsten Boehner;Geri Gay,,,
CHI,2008,Wedge: clutter-free visualization of off-screen locations,10.1145/1357054.1357179,"To overcome display limitations of small-screen devices, researchers have proposed techniques that point users to objects located off-screen. Arrow-based techniques such as City Lights convey only direction. Halo conveys direction and distance, but is susceptible to clutter resulting from overlapping halos. We present Wedge, a visualization technique that conveys direction and distance, yet avoids overlap and clutter. Wedge represents each off-screen location using an acute isosceles triangle: the tip coincides with the off-screen locations, and the two corners are located on-screen. A wedge conveys location awareness primarily by means of its two legs pointing towards the target. Wedges avoid overlap programmatically by repelling each other, causing them to rotate until overlap is resolved. As a result, wedges can be applied to numbers and configurations of targets that would lead to clutter if visualized using halos. We report on a user study comparing Wedge and Halo for three off-screen tasks. Participants were significantly more accurate when using Wedge than when using Halo.",Sean Gustafson;Patrick Baudisch;Carl Gutwin;Pourang Irani,,,
CHI,2008,Generalized selection via interactive query relaxation,10.1145/1357054.1357203,"Selection is a fundamental task in interactive applications, typically performed by clicking or lassoing items of interest. However, users may require more nuanced forms of selection. Selecting regions or attributes may be more important than selecting individual items. Selections may be over dynamic items and selections might be more easily created by relaxing simpler selections (e.g., ""select all items like this one""). Creating such selections requires that interfaces model the declarative structure of the selection, not just individually selected items. We present direct manipulation techniques that couple declarative selection queries with a query relaxation engine that enables users to interactively generalize their selections. We apply our selection techniques in both information visualization and graphics editing applications, enabling generalized selection over both static and dynamic interface objects. A controlled study finds that users create more accurate selection queries when using our generalization techniques.",Jeffrey Heer;Maneesh Agrawala;Wesley Willett,,,
CHI,2008,Sesame: informing user security decisions with system visualization,10.1145/1357054.1357217,"Non-expert users face a dilemma when making security decisions. Their security often cannot be fully automated for them, yet they generally lack both the motivation and technical knowledge to make informed security decisions on their own. To help users with this dilemma, we present a novel security user interface called Sesame. Sesame uses a concrete, spatial extension of the desktop metaphor to provide users with the security-related, visualized system-level information they need to make more informed decisions. It also provides users with actionable controls to affect a system's security state. Sesame graphically facilitates users' comprehension in making these decisions, and in doing so helps to lower the bar for motivating them to participate in the security of their system. In a controlled study, users with Sesame were found to make fewer errors than a control group which suggests that our novel security interface is a viable alternative approach to helping users with their dilemma.",Jennifer Stoll;Craig S.

We report on an exploratory study of individuals, pairs, and triples engaged in information analysis tasks using paper-based visualizations. From our study results, we derive a framework that captures the analysis activities of co-located teams and individuals. Comparing this framework with existing models of the information analysis process suggests that information visualization tools may benefit from providing a flexible temporal flow of analysis actions.",Petra Isenberg;Anthony Tang 0001;Sheelagh Carpendale,,,
CHI,2008,Do visualizations improve synchronous remote collaboration?,10.1145/1357054.1357246,"Information visualizations can improve collaborative problem solving, but this improvement may depend on whether visualizations promote communication. In an experiment on the effect of network visualizations, remote pairs worked synchronously to identify a serial killer. They discussed disparate evidence distributed across the pair using IM. Four conditions, respectively, offered (a) spreadsheet only (controls), (b) individual unshared visualizations, (c) view-only shared visualizations, and (d) a full-access shared visualization of all evidence. We examined collaborative performance, use of the visualization tool, and communication as a function of condition. All visualization conditions improved remote collaborators' performance over the control condition. Full access to a shared visualization best facilitated remote collaboration by encouraging tool use and fostering discussion between the partners. Shared visualization without full access impaired performance somewhat and made communication even more vital to identifying the serial killer. This study provides direct evidence of visualization tool features and partner behavior that promote collaboration.",Aruna D. Balakrishnan;Susan R. Fussell;Sara B. Kiesler,,,
CHI,2008,Supporting the analytical reasoning process in information visualization,10.1145/1357054.1357247,"This paper presents a new information visualization framework that supports the analytical reasoning process. It consists of three views - a data view, a knowledge view and a navigation view. The data view offers interactive information visualization tools. The knowledge view enables the analyst to record analysis artifacts such as findings, hypotheses and so on. The navigation view provides an overview of the exploration process by capturing the visualization states automatically. An analysis artifact recorded in the knowledge view can be linked to a visualization state in the navigation view. The analyst can revisit a visualization state from both the navigation and knowledge views to review the analysis and reuse it to look for alternate views. The whole analysis process can be saved along with the synthesized information. We present a user study and discuss the perceived usefulness of a prototype based on this framework that we have developed.",Yedendra Babu Shrinivasan;Jarke J. van Wijk,,,

CHI,2008,Expandable grids for visualizing and authoring computer security policies,10.1145/1357054.1357285,"We introduce the Expandable Grid, a novel interaction technique for creating, editing, and viewing many types of security policies. Security policies, such as file permissions policies, have traditionally been displayed and edited in user interfaces based on a list of rules, each of which can only be viewed or edited in isolation. These list-of-rules interfaces cause problems for users when multiple rules interact, because the interfaces have no means of conveying the interactions amongst rules to users. Instead, users are left to figure out these rule interactions themselves. An Expandable Grid is an interactive matrix visualization designed to address the problems that list-of-rules interfaces have in conveying policies to users. This paper describes the Expandable Grid concept, shows a system using an Expandable Grid for setting file permissions in the Microsoft Windows XP operating system, and gives results of a user study involving 36 participants in which the Expandable Grid approach vastly outperformed the native Windows XP file-permissions interface on a broad range of policy-authoring tasks.",Robert W.

CHI,2008,On the benefits of confidence visualization in speech recognition,10.1145/1357054.1357288,"In a typical speech dictation interface, the recognizer's best-guess is displayed as normal, unannotated text. This ignores potentially useful information about the recognizer's confidence in its recognition hypothesis. Using a confidence measure (which itself may sometimes be inaccurate), we investigated providing visual feedback about low-confidence portions of the recognition using shaded, red underlining. An evaluation showed, compared to a baseline without underlining, underlining low-confidence areas did not increase user's speed or accuracy in detecting errors. However, we found that when recognition errors were correctly underlined, they were discovered significantly more often than baseline. Conversely, when errors failed to be underlined, they were discovered less often. Our results indicate confidence visualization can be effective --- but only if the confidence measure has high accuracy. Further, since our results show that users tend to trust confidence visualization, designers should be careful in its application if a high accuracy confidence measure is not available.",Keith Vertanen;Per Ola Kristensson,,,

CHI,2007,Improving recognition and characterization in groupware with rich embodiments,10.1145/1240624.1240627,"Embodiments are visual representations of people in a groupware system. Embodiments convey awareness information such as presence, location, and movement -- but they provide far less information than what is available from a real body in a face-to-face setting. As a result, it is often difficult to recognize and characterize other people in a groupware system without extensive communication. To address this problem, information-rich embodiments use ideas from multivariate information visualization to maximize the amount of information that is represented about a person. To investigate the feasibility of rich embodiment and their effects on group interaction, we carried out three studies. The first shows that users are able to recall and interpret a large set of variables that are graphically encoded on an embodiment. The second and third studies demonstrated rich embodiments in two groupware systems -- a multiplayer game and a drawing application -- and showed that the enhanced representations do improve recognition and characterization, and that they can enrich interaction in a variety of ways.",Tadeusz Stach;Carl Gutwin;David Pinelle;Pourang Irani,,,
CHI,2007,Beyond visual acuity: the perceptual scalability of information visualizations for large displays,10.1145/1240624.1240639,"The scalability of information visualizations has typically been limited by the number of available display pixels. As displays become larger, the scalability limit may shift away from the number of pixels and toward human perceptual abilities. This work explores the effect of using large, high resolution displays to scale up information visualizations beyond potential visual acuity limitations. Displays that are beyond visual acuity require physical navigation to see all of the pixels. Participants performed various information visualization tasks using display sizes with a sufficient number of pixels to be within, equal to, or beyond visual acuity. Results showed that performance on most tasks was more efficient and sometimes more accurate because of the additional data that could be displayed, despite the physical navigation that was required. Visualization design issues on large displays are also discussed.",Beth Yost;Yonca Haciahmetoglu;Chris North 0001,,,
CHI,2007,White rooms and morphing don't mix: setting and the evaluation of visualization techniques,10.1145/1240624.1240640,"The results presented in this paper illustrate how a specific map visualization technique is sensitive to setting: a comparative evaluation of the technique gives conflicting results depending on where it takes place. While prior research has explored the impact of factors other than basic visual perception on visualization techniques, relatively little attention has been directed toward the physical setting in which the technique is used. We present results from a study involving 120 participants, comparing the effectiveness of two different geovisualization techniques in promoting recall of map layout. Recall was shown to be sensitive to setting, such that one technique in particular was more effective in a noisy public space than in a controlled, 'white-room' environment. The results have implications for the validation and measurement of information visualization techniques as a whole, and in particular for those employing motion as a communicative attribute.",Derek F.

Even worse, the impact of this distortion is different depending on the location of the information on the display. In this paper, we examine how this distortion affects the perception of the basic graphical elements of information visualization shown on displays at various angles. We first examine perception of these elements on a single display, and then compare this to perception across displays, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various elements for use in a tabletop and multi-display environment. We found that the perception of some graphical elements is more robust to distortion than others. We then develop recommendations for building data visualizations for these environments.",Daniel Wigdor;Chia Shen;Clifton Forlines;Ravin Balakrishnan,,,
CHI,2007,Let's go to the whiteboard: how and why software developers use drawings,10.1145/1240624.1240714,"Software developers are rooted in the written form of their code, yet they often draw diagrams representing their code. Unfortunately, we still know little about how and why they create these diagrams, and so there is little research to inform the design of visual tools to support developers' work. This paper presents findings from semi-structured interviews that have been validated with a structured survey. Results show that most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings. Diagrams that documented design decisions were often externalized in these temporary drawings and then subsequently lost. Current visualization tools and the software development practices that we observed do not solve these issues, but these results suggest several directions for future research.",Mauro Cherubini;Gina Venolia;Robert DeLine;Amy J.

CHI,2007,CAAD: an automatic task support system,10.1145/1240624.1240731,"Recent HCI research shows strong interest in task management systems (e.g. [19, 27]) that support the multi-tasked nature of information work [13]. These systems either require users to manually create and maintain task representations or they depend on explicit user cues to guide the creation and maintenance process. To access and use the task representations in these systems, users must also specify their current task. This interaction overhead inhibits the adoption of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel approach to task management that automates the creation and maintenance of task representations. Our system supports the user by making commonly used information more ""ready-at-hand"" through an intuitive visualization of their task representations. Users can correct and organize their task representations by directly manipulating the visualization; however, this interaction is not required. We describe a feasibility study that demonstrates the actual utility (in terms of overhead reduction) and perceived utility of our system.",Tye Rattenbury;John F. Canny,,,
CHI,2007,Senspectra: a computationally augmented physical modeling toolkit for sensing and visualization of structural strain,10.1145/1240624.1240744,"We present Senspectra, a computationally augmented physical modeling toolkit designed for sensing and visualization of structural strain. Senspectra seeks to explore a new direction in computational materiality, incorporating the material quality of malleable elements of an interface into its digital control structure. The system functions as a decentralized sensor network consisting of nodes, embedded with computational capabilities and a full spectrum LED, and flexible joints. Each joint functions as an omnidirectional bend sensing mechanism to sense and communicate mechanical strain between neighboring nodes. Using Senspectra, a user incrementally assembles and refines a physical 3D model of discrete elements with a real-time visualization of structural strain. While the Senspectra infrastructure provides a flexible modular sensor network platform, its primary application derives from the need to couple physical modeling techniques utilized in architecture and design disciplines with systems for structural engineering analysis. This offers direct manipulation augmented with visual feedback for an intuitive approach to physical real-time finite element analysis, particularly for organic forms.",Vincent Leclerc;Amanda J.

CHI,2007,Seconds matter: improving distributed coordination bytracking and visualizing display trajectories,10.1145/1240624.1240822,"Pauses in distributed groupware activity can indicate anything from technical latency through infrastructure failure to a participant's thoughtful contemplation. Unraveling these ambiguities highlights mismatches between unseen off-screen activities and on-screen cursor behaviors. In this paper we suggest that groupware systems have typically been poor at representing off-screen activities, and introduce the concept of display trajectories to bridge the sensor gap between the display and its surrounding space. We consider requirements for display trajectories using the distributed social scientific analysis of video data as an example domain. Drawing on these requirements, we prototype a freeform whiteboard pen tracking and visualization technique around displays using ultrasound. We describe an experiment which inspects the impact of display trajectories on remote response efficiency. Our findings show that visualization of the display trajectory improves participants' ability to coordinate their actions by one second per interaction turn, reducing latency in organizing turn taking by a 'standard maximum' conversation pause.",Mike Fraser 0001;Michael R.

Many current urban computing systems focus on improving our efficiency and productivity in the city by providing ""location services"" and/or interactive navigation and mapping tools. While agreeing with the need for such systems, we are reminded that urban life spans a much wider range of emotions and experiences. Our claim is that our successful future urban technological tools will be those that incorporate the full range of urban experiences -- from improving productivity and efficiency to promoting wonderment and daydreaming. We discuss intervention as a research strategy for understanding wonderment; demonstrate an example of such a study using a matchbook experiment to expose relationships between locations and emotions within a city; and use the results to develop Sashay -- a mobile phone application that promotes wonderment by visualizing an individual's personal patterns across the invisible, manufactured geography of mobile phone cellular towers.",Eric Paulos;Chris Beckmann,,,

First a number of existing techniques are unified by the commonality of what they show, certain fisheye-related subsets, with the techniques differing only in how they show those subsets. Then the elevated importance of these subsets, and their generality, is used to discuss the possibility of non-visual fisheye-views, to attack problems not so amenable to visualization.

One of the most perplexing challenges facing groupware is effective asynchronous group scheduling (GS). This paper presents a lightweight interaction model for GS that can extend its reach beyond users of current group calendaring solutions. By expressing availability in terms of preferences, we create a flexible framework for GS that preserves plausible deniability while exerting social pressure to encourage honesty among users. We also propose an ontology that enables us to model user preferences with machine learning, predicting user responses to further lower cognitive load. The combination of visualization/direct manipulation with machine learning allows users to easily and efficiently optimize meeting times. We also suggest resulting design implications for this class of intelligent user interfaces.",Mike Brzozowski;Kendra Carattini;Scott R. Klemmer;Patrick Mihelich;Jiang Hu;Andrew Y. Ng,,,

Tactile or haptic displays could be used to provide additional feedback to support a point-and-click type interaction for the visually impaired. A requirements capture conducted with sight impaired computer users produced a review of current accessibility technologies, and guidelines were extracted for using tactile feedback to aid navigation. The results of a qualitative evaluation with a prototype interface are also presented. Providing an absolute position input device and tactile feedback allowed the users to explore the graph using tactile and proprioceptive cues in a manner analogous to point-and-click techniques.",Steven A.

CHI,2005,Who gets to know what when: configuring privacy permissions in an awareness application,10.1145/1054972.1054987,"We report on a study (N=36) of user preferences for balancing awareness with privacy. Participants defined permissions for sharing of location, availability, calendar information and instant messaging (IM) activity within an application called mySpace. MySpace is an interactive visualization of the physical workplace that provides dynamic information about people, places and equipment. We found a significant preference for defining privacy permissions at the group level. While ""family"" received high levels of awareness sharing, interestingly, ""team"" was granted comparable levels during business hours at work. Surprisingly, presenting participants with a detailed list of all pieces of personal context to which the system had access, did not result in more conservative privacy settings. Although location was the most sensitive aspect of awareness, participants were comfortable disclosing room-level location information to their team members at work. Our findings suggest utilizing grouping mechanisms to balance privacy control with configuration burden, and argue for increased system transparency to build trust.",Sameer Patil;Jennifer Lai,,,
CHI,2005,Use of eye movements as feedforward training for a synthetic aircraft inspection task,10.1145/1054972.1054993,"Aircraft inspection is a vital element in assuring safety and reliability of the air transportation system. The human inspector performing visual inspection of an aircraft is the backbone of this process and training is an effective strategy for improving their inspection performance. Previous studies have shown offline feedback training to be effective in improving subsequent visual inspection performance. Because experienced inspectors are known to adopt a better inspection strategy than novices, providing visualization of experts' cognitive processes a priori can accelerate novices' adoption of the experts' strategy. Using eye tracking equipment, we record the point of regard of an expert inspector performing an inspection task in a virtual reality simulator. Analysis of their eye movements leads to a visualization of their scanpaths and allows us to display the inspector's visual search (hence cognitive) strategy. We show how providing this type of scanpath-based feedforward training of novices leads to improved accuracy performance in the simulator coupled with an observed speed-accuracy tradeoff. We contend that the tradeoff results from trained novices adopting a slower paced strategy through increased fixation durations, suggesting trained novices learn a more deliberate target search/discrimination strategy that requires more time to execute.",Sajay Sadasivan;Joel S.

CHI,2005,Studying the effectiveness of MOVE: a contextually optimized in-vehicle navigation system,10.1145/1054972.1055051,"In-vehicle navigation has changed substantially in recent years, due to the advent of computer generated maps and directions. However, these maps are still problematic, due to a mismatch between the complexity of the maps and the attentional demands of driving. In response to this problem, we are developing the MOVE (Maps Optimized for Vehicular Environments) system. This system will provide situationally appropriate map information by presenting information that uses appropriate amounts of the driver's attention. In this paper, we describe our findings of studies to help shape the design of the MOVE system, including studies on map reading and in-vehicle navigation, and studies on the effectiveness of a variety of contextually optimized route map visualizations in a simulated driving context.Results show that contextually optimized displays designed for the MOVE system should significantly reduce perceptual load in the context of driving.

However, clutter is not a well defined concept. In this paper, we present the Feature Congestion measure of display clutter. This measure is based upon extensive modeling of the saliency of elements of a display, and upon a new operational definition of clutter. The current implementation is based upon two features: color and luminance contrast. We have tested this measure on maps that observers ranked by perceived clutter. Results show good agreement between the observers' rankings and our measure of clutter. Furthermore, our measure can be used to make design suggestions in an automated UI critiquing tool.",Ruth Rosenholtz;Yuanzhen Li;Jonathan Mansfield;Zhenlan Jin,,,
CHI,2004,Connecting time-oriented data and information to a coherent interactive visualization,10.1145/985692.985706,"In modern intensive care units (ICUs), the medical staff has to monitor a huge amount of high-dimensional and time-oriented data, which needs to be visualized user- and task-specifically to ease diagnosis and treatment planning. Available visual representations, like diagrams or charts neglect the implicit information as well as a-priory or associated knowledge about the data and its meaning (for example, 38.5°C (101.3°F) is moderate fever and 41°C (105.8°F) is critical fever). Another challenge is to provide appropriate interaction techniques to explore and navigate the data and its temporal dimensions. In this context one major challenge is to connect time-oriented data and information to a coherent interactive visualization. In this paper we present different interactive visualization techniques which enable the users to reveal the data at several levels of detail and abstraction, ranging from a broad overview to the fine structure. We will also introduce a time visualization and navigation technique that connects overview+detail, pan+zoom, and focus+context features to one powerful time-browser.",Ragnar Bade;Stefan Schlechtweg;Silvia Miksch,,,
CHI,2004,Feeling bumps and holes without a haptic interface: the perception of pseudo-haptic textures,10.1145/985692.985723,"We present a new interaction technique to simulate textures in desktop applications without a haptic interface. The proposed technique consists in modifying the motion of the cursor on the computer screen - i.e. the Control/Display ratio. Assuming that the image displayed on the screen corresponds to a top view of the texture, an acceleration (or deceleration) of the cursor indicates a negative (or positive) slope of the texture. Experimental evaluations showed that participants could successfully identify macroscopic textures such as bumps and holes, by simply using the variations of the motion of the cursor. Furthermore, the participants were able to draw the different profiles of bumps and holes which were simulated, correctly. These results suggest that our technique enabled the participants to successfully conjure a mental image of the topography of the macroscopic textures. Applications for this technique are: the feeling of images (pictures, drawings) or GUI components (windows' edges, buttons), the improvement of navigation, or the visualization of scientific data.",Anatole Lécuyer;Jean-Marie Burkhardt;Laurent Étienne,,,

First, we introduce a new exploratory data analysis tool, the history flow visualization, which is effective in revealing patterns within the wiki context and which we believe will be useful in other collaborative situations as well. Second, we discuss several collaboration patterns highlighted by this visualization tool and corroborate them with statistical analysis. Third, we discuss the implications of these patterns for the design and governance of online collaborative social spaces.

We focus on the initial consultations between customer and agent that take place during the development of complex products. Findings from an ethnographic study of the existing use of technological systems show the interaction during such consultations to be disjointed and not well supported. As an alternative approach, we developed a novel arrangement of multiple displays intended to promote shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration using a variety of interlinked representations and visualizations. The resulting interactional workspace was used by a travel company as part of a large international trade show attended by the general public. The many consultations that took place between agents and customers were quite different, proving to be more equitable, open, fluid and congenial.",Tom Rodden;Yvonne Rogers;John Halloran 0001;Ian Taylor,,,
CHI,2003,Understanding sequence and reply relationships within email conversations: a mixed-model visualization,10.1145/642611.642674,"It has been proposed that email clients could be improved if they presented messages grouped into conversations. An email conversation is the tree of related messages that arises from the use of the reply operation. We propose two models of conversation. The first model characterizes a conversation as a chronological sequence of messages; the second as a tree based on the reply relationship. We show how existing email clients and prior research projects implicitly support each model to a greater or lesser degree depending on their design, but none fully supports both models simultaneously. We present a mixed-model visualization that simultaneously presents sequence and reply relationships among the messages of a conversation, making both visible at a glance. We describe the integration of the visualization into a working prototype email client. A usability study indicates that the system meets our usability goals and verifies that the visualization fully conveys both types of relationships within the messages of an email conversation.",Gina Danielle Venolia;Carman Neustaedter,,,
CHI,2003,Halo: a technique for visualizing off-screen objects,10.1145/642611.642695,"As users pan and zoom, display content can disappear into off-screen space, particularly on small-screen devices. The clipping of locations, such as relevant places on a map, can make spatial cognition tasks harder. Halo is a visualization technique that supports spatial cognition by showing users the location of off-screen objects. Halo accomplishes this by surrounding off-screen objects with rings that are just large enough to reach into the border region of the display window. From the portion of the ring that is visible on-screen, users can infer the off-screen location of the object at the center of the ring. We report the results of a user study comparing Halo with an arrow-based visualization technique with respect to four types of map-based route planning tasks. When using the Halo interface, users completed tasks 16-33% faster, while there were no significant differences in error rate for three out of four tasks in our study.",Patrick Baudisch;Ruth Rosenholtz,,,
CHI,2003,Recommending collaboration with social networks: a comparative evaluation,10.1145/642611.642714,"Studies of information seeking and workplace collaboration often find that social relationships are a strong factor in determining who collaborates with whom. Social networks provide one means of visualizing existing and potential interaction in organizational settings. Groupware designers are using social networks to make systems more sensitive to social situations and guide users toward effective collaborations. Yet, the implications of embedding social networks in systems have not been systematically studied. This paper details an evaluation of two different social networks used in a system to recommend individuals for possible collaboration. The system matches people looking for expertise with individuals likely to have expertise. The effectiveness of social networks for matching individuals is evaluated and compared. One finding is that social networks embedded into systems do not match individuals' perceptions of their personal social network. This finding and others raise issues for the use of social networks in groupware. Based on the evaluation results, several design considerations are discussed.",David W. McDonald,,,
CHI,2002,Automating CPM-GOMS,10.1145/503376.503404,"CPM-GOMS is a modeling method that combines the task decomposition of a GOMS analysis with a model of human resource usage at the level of cognitive, perceptual, and motor operations. CPM-GOMS models have made accurate predictions about skilled user behavior in routine tasks, but developing such models is tedious and error-prone. We describe a process for automatically generating CPM-GOMS models from a hierarchical task decomposition expressed in a cognitive modeling tool called Apex. Resource scheduling in Apex automates the difficult task of interleaving the cognitive, perceptual, and motor resources underlying common task operators (e.g. mouse move-and-click). Apex's UI automatically generates PERT charts, which allow modelers to visualize a model's complex parallel behavior. Because interleaving and visualization is now automated, it is feasible to construct arbitrarily long sequences of behavior. To demonstrate the process, we present a model of automated teller interactions in Apex and discuss implications for user modeling",Bonnie E. John;Alonso H.

In this paper, we present a comparison of three such techniques. The first, focus plus context screens, are wall-size low-resolution displays with an embedded high-resolution display region. This technique is compared with overview plus detail and zooming/panning. We interviewed fourteen visual surveillance and design professionals from different areas (graphic design, chip design, air traffic control, etc.) in order to create a repre sentative sample of tasks to be used in two experimental comparison studies. In the first experiment, subjects using focus plus context screens to extract information from large static documents completed the two experimental tasks on average 21% and 36% faster than when they used the other interfaces. In the second experiment, focus plus context screens allowed subjects to reduce their error rate in a driving simulation to less than one third of the error rate of the competing overview plus detail setup",Patrick Baudisch;Nathaniel Good;Victoria Bellotti;Pamela K.

But what improvements do these 3D interfaces offer over their traditional 2D counterparts? This paper describes the comparative evaluation of two document management systems that differ only in the number of dimensions used for displaying and interacting with the data. The 3D system is heavily based on Robertson et al.'s Data Mountain, which supports users in storing, organising and retrieving “thumbnail” representations of documents such as bookmarked Web-pages. Results show that our subjects were faster at storing and retrieving pages in the display when using the 2D interface, but not significantly so. As expected, retrieval times significantly increased as the number of thumbnails increased. Despite the lack of significant differences between the 2D and 3D interfaces, subjective assessments showed a significant preference for the 3D interface.",Andy Cockburn;Bruce J. McKenzie,,,

CHI,2001,Visual information foraging in a focus + context visualization,10.1145/365024.365337,"Eye tracking studies of the Hyperbolic Tree browser [10] suggest that visual search in focus+context displays is highly affected by information scent (i.e., local cues, such as text summaries, used to assess and navigate toward distal information sources). When users detected a strong information scent, they were able to reach their goal faster with the Hyperbolic Tree browser than with a conventional browser. When users detected a weak scent or no scent, users exhibited less efficient search of areas with a high density of visual items. In order to interpret these results we present an integration of the CODE Theory of Visual Attention (CTVA) with information foraging theory.

We report three innovations that address this user need. l We replaced the web page with the web sire as the basic unit of interaction and analysis* We defined a new information structure, the clan graph, that groups together sets of related sites. l We invented a new graph visualization, the auditorium visualization, that reveals important structural and content properties of sites within a clan graph. We have discovered interesting information that can be extracted from the structure of a clan graph. We can identify structurally important sites with many incoming or outgoing links. Lii between sites serve important functions: they often identify “f?ont door” pages of sites, sometimes identify especially significant pages within a site, and occasionally contain informative anchor text.",Loren G.

CHI,1997,Putting Visualization to Work: ProgramFinder for Youth Placement,10.1145/258549.259003,"The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) have been working together to develop the ProgramFinder, a tool for choosing programs for a troubled youth from drug rehabilitation centers to secure residential facilities. The seemingly straightforward journey of the ProgramFinder from an existing user interface technique to a product design required the development of five different prototypes which involved user interface design, prototype implementation, and selecting search criterion. While HCIL’s effort focused primarily on design and implementation, DJJ’s attribute selection process was the most time consuming and difficult task. We also found that a direct link to DJJ’s workflow was needed in the prototypes to generate the necessary “buy-in”. This paper analyzes the interaction between the efforts of HCIL and DJJ and the amount of “buyin” by DJJ staff and management. Lesson learned are presented for developers.",Jason B.

CHI,1996,Silk from a Sow's Ear: Extracting Usable Structures from the Web,10.1145/238386.238450,"In its current implementation, the World-Wide Web lacks much of the explicit structure and strong typing found in many closed hypertext systems. While this property probably relates to the explosive acceptance of the Web, it further complicates the already difficult problem of identifying usable structures and aggregates in large hypertext collections. These reduced structures, or localities, form the basis for simplifying visualizations of and navigation through complex hypertext systems. Much of the previous research into identifying aggregates utilize graph theoretic algorithms based upon structural topology, i.e., the linkages between items. Other research has focused on content analysis to form document collections. This paper presents our exploration into techniques that utilize both the topology and textual similarity between items as well as usage data collected by servers and page meta-information lke title and size.

CHI,1996,Multiagent Model of Dynamic Design: Visualization as an Emergent Behavior of Active Design Agents,10.1145/238386.238566,"This research has been motivated by the lack of models and languages in the visual design field that are able to address design solutions, which continuously adapt in response to the dynamic changes both in the information itself and in the goals or intentions of the information recipient. This paper postulates a muhiagent model of dynamic design--a theoretical framework of design that provides a model with which the visual designer can think during the course of designing. The model employs a decentralized model of design as a premise, and borrows its conceptual model from the improvisational performance, such as dance and music, and bases its theoretical and technical framework on the field of multiagent systems. A design solution is considered an emergent behavior of a collection of active design agents, or performers, each of which is responsible for presenting a particular segment of information. The graphical behaviors of design agents are described by their dynamic activities--rather than by the traditional method of fixed attributes. The model is illustrated with two design projects, Dynamic News Display System and E-Mail Display, both of which were implemented using a multiagent design simulation system, perform, along with an agent description language, persona.",Suguru Ishizaki,,,

CHI,1995,Providing Assurances in a Multimedia Interactive Environment,10.1145/223904.223936,"In ordinary telephone calls, we rely on cues for the assurance that the connection is active and that the other party is listening to what we are saying. For instance, noise on the line (whether it be someone's voice, traffic sounds, or background static from a bad connection) tells us about the state of our connection. Similarly, the occasional ""uhuh"" or muffled sounds from a side conversation tells us about the focus and activity of the person on the line. Conventional telephony is based on a single connection for communication between two parties — as such, it has relatively simple assurance needs. Multimedia, multiparty systems increase the complexity of the communication in two orthogonal directions, leading to a concomitant increase in assurance needs. As the complexity of these systems and services grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to assess the current state of these services and the level of the user interactions within the systems. We have addressed this problem through the use of assurances that are designed to provide information about the connectivity, presence, focus, and activity in an environment that is part virtual and part real. We describe how independent network media services (a virtual meeting room service, a holophonic sound service, an application sharing service, and a 3D augmented reality visualization system) were designed to work together, providing users with coordinated cohesive assurances for virtual contexts in multimedia, multiparty communication and interaction.",Dorée D.

We call this interface technique the Worlds in Miniature (WIM) metaphor. By establishing a direct relationship between life-size objects in the virtual world and miniature objects in the WIM, we can use the WIM as a tool for manipulating objects in the virtual environment. In addition to describing object manipulation, this paper explores ways in which Worlds in Miniature can act as a single unifying metaphor for such application independent interaction techniques as object selection, navigation, path planning, and visualization. The WIM metaphor naturally offers multiple points of view and multiple scales at which the user can operate, all without requiring explicit modes or commands. Informal user observation indicates that users adapt to the Worlds in Miniature metaphor quickly and that physical props are helpful in manipulating the WIM and other objects in the environment.",Richard Stoakley;Matthew Conway;Randy F.

CHI,1995,Visualizing Complex Hypermedia Networks through Multiple Hierarchical Views,10.1145/223904.223947,"Our work concerns visualizing the information space of hypermedia systems using multiple hierarchical views. Although overview diagrams are useful for helping the user to navigate in a hypermedia system, for any real-world system they become too complicated and large to be really useful. This is because these diagrams represent complex network structures which are very difficult to visualize and comprehend. On the other hand, effective visualizations of hierarchies have been developed. Our strategy is to provide the user with different hierarchies, each giving a different perspective to the underlying information space, to help the user better comprehend the information. We propose an algorithm based on content and structural analysis to form hierarchies from hypermedia networks. The algorithm is automatic but can be guided by the user. The multiple hierarchies can be visualized in various ways. We give examples of the implementation of the algorithm on two hypermedia systems.",Sougata Mukherjea;James D. Foley;Scott E. Hudson,,,

Our technique assigns more display space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in the context of the entire hierarchy. The essence of this scheme is to lay out the hierarchy in a uniform way on a hyperbolic plane an d map this plane onto a circular display region. This supports a smooth blending between focus and context, as well as continuous redirection of the focus. We have developed effective procedures for manipulating the focus using pointer clicks as well as interactive dragging, and for smoothly an imating transitions across such manipulation.

CHI,1994,Using aggregation and dynamic queries for exploring large data sets,10.1145/191666.191682,"When working with large data sets, users perform three primary types of activities: data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization. The data manipulation process involves the selection and transformation of data prior to viewing. This paper addresses user goals for this process and the interactive interface mechanisms that support them. We consider three classes of data manipulation goals: controlling the scope (selecting the desired portion of the data), selecting the focus of attention (concentrating on the attributes of data that are relevant to current analysis), and choosing the level of detail (creating and decomposing aggregates of data). We use this classification to evaluate the functionality of existing data exploration interface techniques. Based on these results, we have expanded an interface mechanism called the Aggregate Manipulator (AM) and combined it with Dynamic Query (DQ) to provide complete coverage of the data manipulation goals. We use real estate sales data to demonstrate how the AM and DQ synergistically function in our interface.",Jade Goldstein;Steven F. Roth,,,

These tools can be interactively positioned over on-screen applications much as a magnifying glass is moved over a newspaper. They can be used to help the user understand various types of information, from text documents to scientific visualizations. Because these filters are movable and apply to only part of the screen, they have a number of advantages over traditional windowwide viewing modes: they employ an attractive metaphor based on physical lenses, show a modified view in the context of the original view, limit clutter to a small region, allow easy construction of visual macros and provide a uniform paradigm that can be extended across different types of information and applications. This paper describes these advantages in more detail and illustrates them with examples of magic lens filters in use over a variety of applications. CR",Maureen C. Stone;Kenneth P. Fishkin;Eric A.

CHI,1994,Passive real-world interface props for neurosurgical visualization,10.1145/191666.191821,"We claim that physical manipulation of familiar real-world objects in the user’s real environment is an important technique for the design of three-dimensional user interfaces. These real-world passive inte~ace props are manipulated by the user to specify spatial relationships between interface objects. By unobtrusively embedding free-space position and orientation trackers within the props, we enable the computer to passively observe a natural user dialog in the real world, rather than forcing the user to engage in a contrived dialog in the computer-generated world. We present neurosurgical planning as a driving application and demonstrate the utility of a head viewing prop, a cutting-plane selection prop, and a trajectory selection prop in this domain. Using passive props in this interface exploits the surgeon’s existing skills, provides direct action-task correspondence, eliminates explicit modes for separate tools, facilitates natural two-handed interaction, and provides tactile and kinesthetic feedback for the user. Our informal evaluation sessions have shown that with a cursory introduction, neurosurgeons who have never seenthe interface can understand and use it without training.",Ken Hinckley;Randy Pausch;John C.

CHI,1993,Fish tank virtual reality,10.1145/169059.169066,"The defining characteristics of what we call “Fish Tank Virtual Reality” are a stereo image of a three dimensional (3D) scene viewed on a monitor using a perspective projection coupled to the head position of the observer. We discuss some of the relative merits of this mode of viewing as compared to head mounted stereo displays. In addition, we report the experimental investigation of the following variables: 1) whether or not the perspective view is coupled to the actual viewpoint of the observer, 2) whether stereopsis is employed. Experiment 1 involved the subjective comparison of pairs of viewing conditions and the results suggest that head coupling may be more important than stereo in yielding a strong impression of three dimensionality. Experiment 2 involved subjects tracing a path from a leaf of a 3D tree to the correct root (there were two trees intermeshed). The error rates ranged from 22% in the pictorial display, to 1.3% in the head coupled stereo display. The error rates for stereo alone and head coupling alone were 14.7% and 3.2% respectively. We conclude that head coupling is probably more important than stereo in 3D visualization and that head coupling and stereo combined provide an important enhancement to monitor based computer graphics.",Colin Ware;Kevin Arthur;Kellogg S.

CHI,1993,High interaction data visualization using Seesoft to visualize program change history (abstract),10.1145/169059.169480,"A problem in developing large software systems is understanding the source code. This problem is difficult because of the volume of code. The listing for a moderately sized system with 100,000 lines, printed 50 lines per page, would run 2,000 pa~s. This video shows a new software tool, Seesoft , that applies scientific visualization techniques to visualizing code. The visualization approach is to represent files in a directoty in columns and the source code lines as rows of colored pixels. The indentation and length of each row of pixe18 corresponds to the actual code. The color of each row of pixels is determined by a statistic such as the age, programmer, or type of line, that we obtain from the change management system. The visual impression is that of a miniature picture of the source code with the indentation showing the usual C controls structure and the color showing the spatial distribution of the statistic. A user may adjust the display using direct manipulation techniques to discover interesting patterns in the code. Software engineering concepts such as complexity and bug fix on fix density can be visualized. The main interest of this work to the human factors community is the use of graphical user interface for selecting and combining statistics from a database, the effective use of hundreds of colors to display a mass of data, and the reduction of the point-and-click direct manipulation metaphor to just pointing, e.g. something of interest will occur where ever the mouse points to on the display.",Joseph L.

It is difficult to sort and continuously resort tables or listings by more than one attribute and still maintain an understanding of the origin and natural position of items. The concept of “value bars” was created to help users visualize and navigate large information spaces that have characteristics of a lineoriented listing with multiple, quantifiable attributes. In general, value bars are useful for analyzing multi-attxibute listings and tables where a particular sort order should be maintained and analysis of the top percentage of items within each attribute is beneficial, The main features are: “ the ability to see in one view an attribute distribution overview for the “important” items (as defined by attribute values) in a fisheye view [3] variant, ● very small screenspace footprint, ● the ability to see at once many attribute overviews, ● the ability to locate outliers and exceptions, and ● extremely low cognitive load navigation.

The intellectual process of understanding the structure and function of molecules is linked to visualizing the complex spatial relationships within these structures, and since the user ia only presented images of models, this intellectual process must proceed without being able to physically handle and make experimental “hand driven” modifications of a physical model. Finally, macromolecules are often globular in shape, of course bear no resemblance to macroscopic physical objects in the real world, and hence make it inherently difficult for the human visual system to accurately perceive the complex spatial relationships that are ao crucial to chemical activity.",Thomas E.

CHI,1991,Information visualization using 3D interactive animation,10.1145/108844.109003,"INTRODUCTION Information Visualization uses computer graphics and interactive animation to stimulate recognition of patterns and structure in information. It does so by exploiting the human perceptual system in ways similar to Scientific Visualization, which allows scientists to perceive patterns in large data collections. While Scientific Visualization typically works on data from simulations of physical processes, Information Visualization works on the structure of information inherent in large information spaces. This video shows a prototype system, called the Information Visualizer, and two information visualization techniques used to access information both by structure and by content. Cone Trees are used for visualizing hierarchical information structures. The Perspective Wall is used for visualizing linear information structures. Both techniques use 3D to maximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure. Interactive animation is used to shift some of the user’s cognitive load to the human perceptual system.

While much of the research has focused on improving accessibility for screen reader users, the specific needs of people with remaining vision (i.e., low-vision individuals) have been largely unaddressed. To bridge this gap, we conducted a qualitative study that provides insights into how low-vision individuals experience visualizations. We found that participants utilized various strategies to examine visualizations using the screen magnifiers and also observed that the default zoom level participants use for general purposes may not be optimal for reading visualizations. We identified that participants relied on their prior knowledge and memory to minimize the traversing cost when examining visualization. Based on the findings, we motivate a personalized tool to accommodate varying visual conditions of low-vision individuals and derive the design goals and features of the tool.",Yanan Wang;Yuhang Zhao 0001;Yea-Seul Kim,,,

First, it automatically segments actors from videos and assigns roles using name tags, color filters, and face swaps. Second, it positions video layers on a virtual stage and allows users to record shots using mobile as a proxy for a virtual camera. These features were developed based on formative interviews by reflecting indie filmmakers' needs and working methods.

CHI,2024,Do You See What I See? A Qualitative Study Eliciting High-Level Visualization Comprehension,10.1145/3613904.3642813,"Designers often create visualizations to achieve specific high-level analytical or communication goals. These goals require people to naturally extract complex, contextualized, and interconnected patterns in data. While limited prior work has studied general high-level interpretation, prevailing perceptual studies of visualization effectiveness primarily focus on isolated, predefined, low-level tasks, such as estimating statistical quantities. This study more holistically explores visualization interpretation to examine the alignment between designers' communicative goals and what their audience sees in a visualization, which we refer to as their comprehension. We found that statistics people effectively estimate from visualizations in classical graphical perception studies may differ from the patterns people intuitively comprehend in a visualization. We conducted a qualitative study on three types of visualizations—line graphs, bar graphs, and scatterplots—to investigate the high-level patterns people naturally draw from a visualization. Participants described a series of graphs using natural language and think-aloud protocols. We found that comprehension varies with a range of factors, including graph complexity and data distribution. Specifically, 1) a visualization's stated objective often does not align with people's comprehension, 2) results from traditional experiments may not predict the knowledge people build with a graph, and 3) chart type alone is insufficient to predict the information people extract from a graph. Our study confirms the importance of defining visualization effectiveness from multiple perspectives to assess and inform visualization practices.",Ghulam Jilani Quadri;Arran Zeyu Wang;Zhehao Wang;Jennifer Adorno Nieves;Paul Rosen 0001;Danielle Albers Szafir,,,

Our system employs an active preference learning paradigm to rank expert-designed colormaps and create new ones from pairwise comparisons, allowing analysts who are novices in color design to tailor colormaps to their data context. We accomplish this by treating colormap design as a path planning problem through the CIELAB colorspace with a context-specific reward model. In an evaluation with twelve scientists, we found that Cieran effectively modeled user preferences to rank colormaps and leveraged this model to create new quality designs. Our work shows the potential of active preference learning for supporting efficient visualization design optimization.",Matt-Heun Hong;Zachary Nolan Sunberg;Danielle Albers Szafir,,,
CHI,2024,When the Body Became Data: Historical Data Cultures and Anatomical Illustration,10.1145/3613904.3642056,"With changing attitudes around knowledge, medicine, art, and technology, the human body has become a source of information and, ultimately, shareable and analyzable data. Centuries of illustrations and visualizations of the body occur within particular historical, social, and political contexts. These contexts are enmeshed in different so-called data cultures: ways that data, knowledge, and information are conceptualized and collected, structured and shared. In this work, we explore how information about the body was collected as well as the circulation, impact, and persuasive force of the resulting images. We show how mindfulness of data cultural influences remain crucial for today's designers, researchers, and consumers of visualizations. We conclude with a call for the field to reflect on how visualizations are not timeless and contextless mirrors on objective data, but as much a product of our time and place as the visualizations of the past.",Michael Correll;Laura A.

CHI,2024,DynaVis: Dynamically Synthesized UI Widgets for Visualization Editing,10.1145/3613904.3642639,"Users often rely on GUIs to edit and interact with visualizations — a daunting task due to the large space of editing options. As a result, users are either overwhelmed by a complex UI or constrained by a custom UI with a tailored, fixed subset of options with limited editing flexibility. Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) are emerging as a feasible alternative for users to specify edits. However, NLIs forgo the advantages of traditional GUI: the ability to explore and repeat edits and see instant visual feedback. We introduce DynaVis, which blends natural language and dynamically synthesized UI widgets. As the user describes an editing task in natural language, DynaVis performs the edit and synthesizes a persistent widget that the user can interact with to make further modifications.

CHI,2024,PromptCharm: Text-to-Image Generation through Multi-modal Prompting and Refinement,10.1145/3613904.3642803,"The recent advancements in Generative AI have significantly advanced the field of text-to-image generation. The state-of-the-art text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion, is now capable of synthesizing high-quality images with a strong sense of aesthetics. Crafting text prompts that align with the model's interpretation and the user's intent thus becomes crucial. However, prompting remains challenging for novice users due to the complexity of the stable diffusion model and the non-trivial efforts required for iteratively editing and refining the text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptCharm, a mixed-initiative system that facilitates text-to-image creation through multi-modal prompt engineering and refinement. To assist novice users in prompting, PromptCharm first automatically refines and optimizes the user's initial prompt. Furthermore, PromptCharm supports the user in exploring and selecting different image styles within a large database. To assist users in effectively refining their prompts and images, PromptCharm renders model explanations by visualizing the model's attention values. If the user notices any unsatisfactory areas in the generated images, they can further refine the images through model attention adjustment or image inpainting within the rich feedback loop of PromptCharm. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of PromptCharm, we conducted a controlled user study with 12 participants and an exploratory user study with another 12 participants. These two studies show that participants using PromptCharm were able to create images with higher quality and better aligned with the user's expectations compared with using two variants of PromptCharm that lacked interaction or visualization support.",Zhijie Wang;Yuheng Huang;Da Song;Lei Ma 0003;Tianyi Zhang 0001,,,

Through a user study (N=14) with creative writers, we examine thinking and usage patterns of CharacterMeet, a prototype system allowing writers to progressively manifest characters through conversation while customizing context, character appearance, voice, and background image. We discover that CharacterMeet facilitates iterative character construction. Specifically, participants, including those with more linear usual approaches, alternated between writing and personalized exploration through visualization of ideas on CharacterMeet while visuals and audio enhanced immersion.

CHI,2024,The HaLLMark Effect: Supporting Provenance and Transparent Use of Large Language Models in Writing with Interactive Visualization,10.1145/3613904.3641895,"The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for writing has sparked controversy both among readers and writers. On one hand, writers are concerned that LLMs will deprive them of agency and ownership, and readers are concerned about spending their time on text generated by soulless machines. On the other hand, AI-assistance can improve writing as long as writers can conform to publisher policies, and as long as readers can be assured that a text has been verified by a human. We argue that a system that captures the provenance of interaction with an LLM can help writers retain their agency, conform to policies, and communicate their use of AI to publishers and readers transparently. Thus we propose HaLLMark, a tool for visualizing the writer's interaction with the LLM. We evaluated HaLLMark with 13 creative writers, and found that it helped them retain a sense of control and ownership of the text.",Md. Naimul Hoque;Tasfia Mashiat;Bhavya Ghai;Cecilia D.

With growing complexity and countless interactions in modern games, capturing how damage unfolds becomes an intricate problem - for developers just as for players. Misunderstanding how to optimize damage potentials includes risks of game imbalances, game-breaking exploits, mismatches between player skill and challenge (harming flow), and impaired perceived competence. All of these considerably impact player experience, game reception, success, and retention, yet polishing optimal strategies remains often a player community effort. To accelerate, inform and ease this process, we implemented an interactive tool capable of simulating, visualizing, planning and comparing damage strategies in video games.

In this work, we perform a crowd-sourced study measuring decision-making quality in visual analytics, testing both an explicit structure of incentives designed to reward cautious decision-making as well as a variety of designs for communicating uncertainty. We find that, while participants are unable to perfectly control for false discoveries as well as idealised statistical models such as the Benjamini-Hochberg, certain forms of uncertainty visualisations can improve the quality of participants' decisions and lead to fewer false discoveries than not correcting for multiple comparisons.

Then, through an iterative design process with six users, we explore and implement interactive techniques for activating and analyzing with situated visualization. To assess the effectiveness and acceptance of these interactions, we integrate them into an AR prototype and conduct a within-subjects study in public scenarios using conventional hand-only interactions as the baseline.

CHI,2024,Input Visualization: Collecting and Modifying Data with Visual Representations,10.1145/3613904.3642808,"We examine input visualizations, visual representations that are designed to collect (and represent) new data rather than encode preexisting datasets. Information visualization is commonly used to reveal insights and stories within existing data. As a result, most contemporary visualization approaches assume existing datasets as the starting point for design, through which that data is mapped to visual encodings. Meanwhile, the implications of visualizations as inputs and as data sources have received little attention—despite the existence of visual and physical examples stretching back centuries. In this paper, we present a design space of 50 input visualizations analyzing their visual representation, data, artifact, context, and input. Based on this, we identify input modalities, purposes of input visualizations, and a set of design considerations. Finally, we discuss the relationship between input visualization and traditional visualization design and suggest opportunities for future research to better understand these visual representations and their potential.",Nathalie Bressa;Jordan Louis;Wesley Willett;Samuel Huron,,,

Currently, creating data-driven iconic images to represent individuals in a dataset often requires considerable design effort. Generative text-to-image models can streamline the process of creating these images, but risk perpetuating designer biases in addition to stereotypes latent in the models. In response, we outline a conceptual workflow for crafting anthropographic assets for visualizations, highlighting possible sources of risk and bias as well as opportunities for reflection and refinement by a human designer. Using an implementation of this workflow with Stable Diffusion and Google Colab, we illustrate a variety of new anthropographic designs that showcase the visual expressiveness and scalability of these generative approaches.

CHI,2024,That's Rough! Encoding Data into Roughness for Physicalization,10.1145/3613904.3641900,"While visual channels (e.g., color, shape, size) have been explored for visualizing data in data physicalizations, there is a lack of understanding regarding how to encode data into physical material properties (e.g., roughness, hardness). This understanding is critical for ensuring data is correctly communicated and for potentially extending the channels and bandwidth available for encoding that data. We present a method to encode ordinal data into roughness, validated through user studies. In the first study, we identified just noticeable differences in perceived roughness from this method. In the second study, we 3D-printed proof of concepts for five different multivariate physicalizations using the model.

CHI,2024,VisTorch: Interacting with Situated Visualizations using Handheld Projectors,10.1145/3613904.3642857,"Spatial data is best analyzed in situ, but existing mixed reality technologies can be bulky, expensive, or unsuitable for collaboration. We present VisTorch: a handheld device for projected situated analytics consisting of a pico-projector, a multi-spectrum camera, and a touch surface. VisTorch enables viewing charts situated in physical space by simply pointing the device at a surface to reveal visualizations in that location. We evaluated the approach using both a user study and an expert review. In the former, we asked 20 participants to first organize charts in space and then refer to these charts to answer questions. We observed three spatial and one temporal pattern in participant analyses. In the latter, four experts—a museum designer, a statistical software developer, a theater stage designer, and an environmental educator—utilized VisTorch to derive practical usage scenarios. Results from our study showcase the utility of situated visualizations for memory and recall.",Biswaksen Patnaik;Huaishu Peng;Niklas Elmqvist,,,
CHI,2024,Reading Between the Pixels: Investigating the Barriers to Visualization Literacy,10.1145/3613904.3642760,"In our current visual-centric digital age, the capability to interpret, understand, and produce visual representations of data —termed visualization literacy— is paramount. However, not everyone is adept at navigating this visual terrain. This paper explores the barriers that individuals who misread a visualization encounter, aiming to understand their specific mental gaps. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, we administered the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) to a group of 120 participants drawn from diverse demographic backgrounds, which provided us with 1774 task completions. We augmented the standard VLAT test to capture quantitative and qualitative data on participants' errors. We collected participant sketches and open-ended text about their analysis approach, providing insight into users' mental models and rationale. Our findings reveal that individuals who incorrectly answer visualization literacy questions often misread visual channels, confound chart labels with data values, or struggle to translate data-driven questions into visual queries. Recognizing and bridging visualization literacy gaps not only ensures inclusivity but also enhances the overall effectiveness of visual communication in our society.",Carolina Nobre;Kehang Zhu;Eric Mörth;Hanspeter Pfister;Johanna Beyer,,,
CHI,2024,Data Cubes in Hand: A Design Space of Tangible Cubes for Visualizing 3D Spatio-Temporal Data in Mixed Reality,10.1145/3613904.3642740,"Tangible interfaces in mixed reality (MR) environments allow for intuitive data interactions. Tangible cubes, with their rich interaction affordances, high maneuverability, and stable structure, are particularly well-suited for exploring multi-dimensional data types. However, the design potential of these cubes is underexplored. This study introduces a design space for tangible cubes in MR, focusing on interaction space, visualization space, sizes, and multiplicity. Using spatio-temporal data, we explored the interaction affordances of these cubes in a workshop (N=24). We identified unique interactions like rotating, tapping, and stacking, which are linked to augmented reality (AR) visualization commands. Integrating user-identified interactions, we created a design space for tangible-cube interactions and visualization. A prototype visualizing global health spending with small cubes was developed and evaluated, supporting both individual and combined cube manipulation.

But what makes for usable or useful customization? We identify four design goals for how BLV people should be able to customize screen-reader-accessible visualizations: presence, or what content is included; verbosity, or how concisely content is presented; ordering, or how content is sequenced; and, duration, or how long customizations are active. To meet these goals, we model a customization as a sequence of content tokens, each with a set of adjustable properties. We instantiate our model by extending Olli, an open-source accessible visualization toolkit, with a settings menu and command box for persistent and ephemeral customization respectively. Through a study with 13 BLV participants, we find that customization increases the ease of identifying and remembering information. However, customization also introduces additional complexity, making it more helpful for users familiar with similar tools.",Shuli Jones;Isabella Pedraza Pineros;Daniel Hajas;Jonathan Zong;Arvind Satyanarayan,,,
CHI,2024,Data Storytelling in Data Visualisation: Does it Enhance the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Information Retrieval and Insights Comprehension?,10.1145/3613904.3643022,"Data storytelling (DS) is rapidly gaining attention as an approach that integrates data, visuals, and narratives to create data stories that can help a particular audience to comprehend the key messages underscored by the data with enhanced efficiency and effectiveness. It is been posited that DS can be especially advantageous for audiences with limited visualisation literacy, by presenting the data clearly and concisely. However, empirical studies confirming whether data stories indeed provide these benefits over conventional data visualisations are scarce. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study with 103 participants to determine whether DS indeed improve both efficiency and effectiveness in tasks related to information retrieval and insights comprehension. Our findings suggest that data stories do improve the efficiency of comprehension tasks, as well as the effectiveness of comprehension tasks that involve a single insight, compared with conventional visualisations.

CHI,2024,Taking ASCII Drawings Seriously: How Programmers Diagram Code,10.1145/3613904.3642683,"Documentation in codebases facilitates knowledge transfer. But tools for programming are largely text-based, and so developers resort to creating ASCII diagrams—graphical artifacts approximated with text—to show visual ideas within their code. Despite real-world use, little is known about these diagrams. We interviewed nine authors of ASCII diagrams, learning why they use ASCII and what roles the diagrams play. We also compile and analyze a corpus of 507 ASCII diagrams from four open source projects, deriving a design space with seven dimensions that classify what these diagrams show, how they show it, and ways they connect to code. These investigations reveal that ASCII diagrams are professional artifacts used across many steps in the development lifecycle, diverse in role and content, and used because they visualize ideas within the variety of programming tools in use.

CHI,2024,SalienTime: User-driven Selection of Salient Time Steps for Large-Scale Geospatial Data Visualization,10.1145/3613904.3642944,"The voluminous nature of geospatial temporal data from physical monitors and simulation models poses challenges to efficient data access, often resulting in cumbersome temporal selection experiences in web-based data portals. Thus, selecting a subset of time steps for prioritized visualization and pre-loading is highly desirable. Addressing this issue, this paper establishes a multifaceted definition of salient time steps via extensive need-finding studies with domain experts to understand their workflows. Building on this, we propose a novel approach that leverages autoencoders and dynamic programming to facilitate user-driven temporal selections. Structural features, statistical variations, and distance penalties are incorporated to make more flexible selections. User-specified priorities, spatial regions, and aggregations are used to combine different perspectives. We design and implement a web-based interface to enable efficient and context-aware selection of time steps and evaluate its efficacy and usability through case studies, quantitative evaluations, and expert interviews.",Juntong Chen;Haiwen Huang;Huayuan Ye;Zhong Peng;Chenhui Li;Changbo Wang,,,

This study questions the viability of employing visual data, specifically images, in innovative queries for music search, and it aims to better align search results with users' moods and situational context. We designed and evaluated three prototype systems for music search—TTTune (text-based), VisTune (image-based), and VTTune (hybrid)—to comparatively assess user experience and system usability. In a comprehensive user study involving 236 participants, each participant interacted with one of the systems and subsequently completed post-experimental surveys. A subset of participants also participated in in-depth interviews to further elucidate the potential and the advantages of image-based music retrieval (IMR) systems. Our findings reveal a marked preference for the user experience and usability offered by the IMR approach, as compared with the traditional text-based method. This underscores the potential of the image in an effective search query.

In virtual reality (VR), we can design the crossing and the appearance of such boundaries in non-realistic ways. However, it is unclear whether locomotion techniques like teleportation, which avoid crossing the boundary altogether, still induce the effect. Furthermore, it is unclear how different appearances of a doorway act as a boundary and thus induce the effect. To address these questions, we conducted two lab studies. First, we conceptually replicated prior doorway effect studies in VR using natural walking and teleportation. Second, we investigated the effect of five doorway visualizations, ranging from doors to portals. The results show no difference in object recognition performance due to the presence of a doorway, locomotion technique, or doorway visualization.

When assisting humans in a collaborative task, robots need to communicate their uncertainty to help inform decisions. In this study, we examine the use of visualising a robot's uncertainty in a high-stakes assisted decision-making task. In particular, we explore how different modalities of uncertainty visualisations (graphical display vs. the robot's embodied behaviour) and confidence levels (low, high, 100%) conveyed by a robot affect the human decision-making and perception during a collaborative task. Our results show that these visualisations significantly impact how participants arrive to their decision as well as how they perceive the robot's transparency across the different confidence levels. We highlight potential trade-offs and offer implications for robot-assisted decision-making. Our work contributes empirical insights on how humans make use of uncertainty visualisations conveyed by a robot in a critical robot-assisted decision-making scenario.",Sarah Schömbs;Saumya Pareek;Jorge Goncalves;Wafa Johal,,,
CHI,2024,DeepSee: Multidimensional Visualizations of Seabed Ecosystems,10.1145/3613904.3642001,"Scientists studying deep ocean microbial ecosystems use limited numbers of sediment samples collected from the seafloor to characterize important life-sustaining biogeochemical cycles in the environment. Yet conducting fieldwork to sample these extreme remote environments is both expensive and time consuming, requiring tools that enable scientists to explore the sampling history of field sites and predict where taking new samples is likely to maximize scientific return. We conducted a collaborative, user-centered design study with a team of scientific researchers to develop DeepSee, an interactive data workspace that visualizes 2D and 3D interpolations of biogeochemical and microbial processes in context together with sediment sampling history overlaid on 2D seafloor maps. Based on a field deployment and qualitative interviews, we found that DeepSee increased the scientific return from limited sample sizes, catalyzed new research workflows, reduced long-term costs of sharing data, and supported teamwork and communication between team members with diverse research goals.",Adam Coscia;Haley M.

CHI,2024,PD-Insighter: A Visual Analytics System to Monitor Daily Actions for Parkinson's Disease Treatment,10.1145/3613904.3642215,"People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) can slow the progression of their symptoms with physical therapy. However, clinicians lack insight into patients' motor function during daily life, preventing them from tailoring treatment protocols to patient needs. This paper introduces PD-Insighter, a system for comprehensive analysis of a person's daily movements for clinical review and decision-making. PD-Insighter provides an overview dashboard for discovering motor patterns and identifying critical deficits during activities of daily living and an immersive replay for closely studying the patient's body movements with environmental context. Developed using an iterative design study methodology in consultation with clinicians, we found that PD-Insighter's ability to aggregate and display data with respect to time, actions, and local environment enabled clinicians to assess a person's overall functioning during daily life outside the clinic. PD-Insighter's design offers future guidance for generalized multiperspective body motion analytics, which may significantly improve clinical decision-making and slow the functional decline of PD and other medical conditions.",Jade Kandel;Chelsea Duppen;Qian Zhang 0066;Howard Jiang;Angelos Angelopoulos;Ashley Paula-Ann Neall;Pranav Wagh;Daniel Szafir;Henry Fuchs;Michael Lewek;Danielle Albers Szafir,,,

Games as experiential systems are known to foster playful engagement and reflection. We propose a novel approach to promoting activity engagement for gut health and its reflection through the design of the Go-Go Biome game. The game simulates the interplay between friendly and unfriendly gut microbes, encouraging real-world activity engagement for gut-microbial balance through interactive visuals, unstructured play mechanics, and reflective design principles. A field study with 14 participants revealed that important facets of our game design led to awareness, playful visualisation, and reflection on factors influencing gut health. Our findings suggest four design lenses– bio-temporality, visceral conversations, wellness comparison, and inner discovery, to aid future playful design explorations to foster gut health engagement and reflection.",Nandini Pasumarthy;Shreyas Nisal;Jessica Danaher;Elise van den Hoven;Rohit Ashok Khot,,,

To fill this gap we introduce SalChartQA – a novel crowd-sourced dataset that uses the BubbleView interface to track user attention and a question-answering (QA) paradigm to induce different information needs in users. SalChartQA contains 74,340 answers to 6,000 questions on 3,000 visualisations. Informed by our analyses demonstrating the close correlation between information needs and visual saliency, we propose the first computational method to predict question-driven saliency on visualisations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models for several metrics, such as the correlation coefficient and the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

In addition to sonification and textual descriptions that are commonly employed by existing accessible visualizations, our MAIDR (multimodal access and interactive data representation) system incorporates two additional modalities (braille and review) that offer complementary benefits. It also provides blind users with the autonomy and control to interactively access and understand data visualizations. In a user study involving 11 blind participants, we found the MAIDR system facilitated the accurate interpretation of statistical visualizations. Participants exhibited a range of strategies in combining multiple modalities, influenced by their past interactions and experiences with data visualizations. This work accentuates the overlooked potential of combining refreshable tactile representation with other modalities and elevates the discussion on the importance of user autonomy when designing accessible data visualizations.",Jooyoung Seo;Yilin Xia;Bongshin Lee;Sean McCurry;Yu Jun Yam,,,
CHI,2024,To Cut or Not To Cut? A Systematic Exploration of Y-Axis Truncation,10.1145/3613904.3642102,"Y-axis truncation is a well-known, much-debated visualization practice. Our work complements existing empirical work by providing a systematic analysis of y-axis truncation on grouped bar charts. Drawing upon theoretical frameworks such as Algebraic Visualization Design, we examine how structure-preserving modifications to visualization affect user performance by systematically dividing the space of possible truncations according to their monotonicity and the type of relations in the underlying data. Our results demonstrate that for comparing and estimating the difference between the lengths of two bars, truncating the y-axis does not affect task performance. For comparing or estimating the relative growth between two bars, truncating monotonically has similar performance to no truncation, while truncating non-monotonically is very likely to impair performance. We discuss possible extensions of our work and recommendations for y-axis truncation.

CHI,2024,Promoting Eco-Friendly Behaviour through Virtual Reality - Implementation and Evaluation of Immersive Feedback Conditions of a Virtual CO2 Calculator,10.1145/3613904.3642957,"Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges in the 21st century. Urgent actions favoring the environment's well-being are essential to mitigate its potentially irreversible consequences. However, the delayed and often distant nature of the effects of sustainable behavior makes it challenging for individuals to connect with the issue personally. Immersive media are an opportunity to introduce innovative feedback mechanisms to highlight the urgency of behavior effects. We introduce a VR carbon calculator that visualizes users' annual carbon footprint as CO2-filled balloons over multiple periods. In a 2 × 2 design, participants calculated and visualized their carbon footprint numerically or as balloons over one or three years. We found no effect of our visualization but a significant impact of the visualized period on participants' environmental self-efficacy. These findings emphasize the importance of target-oriented design in VR behavior interventions.",Carolin Wienrich;Stephanie Vogt;Nina Döllinger;David Obremski,,,

To answer these questions, we conducted a mixed-methods analysis of the public's engagement with data visualization posts about COVID-19 on Twitter. Compared to posts with accurate visual insights, our results show that posts with misleading visualizations garner more replies in which the audiences point out nuanced fallacies and caveats in data interpretations.

CHI,2024,ProInterAR: A Visual Programming Platform for Creating Immersive AR Interactions,10.1145/3613904.3642527,"AR applications commonly contain diverse interactions among different AR contents. Creating such applications requires creators to have advanced programming skills for scripting interactive behaviors of AR contents, repeated transferring and adjustment of virtual contents from virtual to physical scenes, testing by traversing between desktop interfaces and target AR scenes, and digitalizing AR contents. Existing immersive tools for prototyping/authoring such interactions are tailored for domain-specific applications. To support programming general interactive behaviors of real object(s)/environment(s) and virtual object(s)/environment(s) for novice AR creators, we propose ProInterAR, an integrated visual programming platform to create immersive AR applications with a tablet and an AR-HMD. Users can construct interaction scenes by creating virtual contents and augmenting real contents from the view of an AR-HMD, script interactive behaviors by stacking blocks from a tablet UI, and then execute and control the interactions in the AR scene.

However, a designer may create a grammatically-correct visualization that still leaves audiences susceptible to reasoning misleaders, e.g. by failing to normalize data or using unrepresentative samples. Reasoning misleaders are especially pernicious when presenting public policy data, where data-driven decisions can affect public health, safety, and economic development. Through textual analysis, a formative evaluation, and iterative design with 19 policy communicators, we construct an actionable visualization design framework, V-FRAMER, that effectively synthesizes ways of mitigating reasoning misleaders. We discuss important design considerations for frameworks like V-FRAMER, including using concrete examples to help designers understand reasoning misleaders, and using a hierarchical structure to support example-based accessing. We further describe V-FRAMER's congruence with current practice and how practitioners might integrate the framework into their existing workflows.

We visualised eye-tracking data to conduct a heatmap analysis of the four groups' gaze behaviour over time. We found interruptions initiated a phase during which participants interleaved their attention between monitoring and entertainment. This improved monitoring behaviour was more pronounced in combination compared to interruption, suggesting pre-warning interruptions have positive effects. The same addition had negative effects without interruptions (comparing baseline & display).

As foot-based interactions in HMDs become more prevalent, self-occlusion becomes a more pronounced issue due to the involvement of the body and legs. This work presents SeeThroughBody, a body-rendering approach designed to mitigate occlusion and enhance touch interactions between the foot and interactive floor in virtual environments. Our user study unveiled twofold results. First, changing VisualizationStyles and BodyPartsVisibility can improve objective performance (e.g., time, movement) by reducing occlusion. Second, these modifications also affect the subjective user experience (e.g., embodiment, usability). Different VisualizationStyles and BodyPartsVisibility have varying impacts, presenting trade-offs between performance and experience.

CHI,2025,Uncertainty in Science is Malleable. Advocating for User-Agency in Defining Uncertainty in Visualizations: a Case Study in Geology,10.1145/3706598.3713972,"Uncertainty is inherent in science built on previous results. In geoscience, for instance, researchers analyzing volcanic deposits assess the uncertainty around past deposit classifications. To aid this assessment, we followed a design by immersion approach to co-design uncertainty visualizations. We observed that besides visualizing it, it is challenging even to define what constitutes uncertainty, as how researchers understand and process uncertainty evolves. This motivated us to reach other members of the community to better understand how they integrate uncertainty in their work. Informed by a series of interviews, we first redesigned our visualization system and then introduced it as a technology probe to a broader community of geoscientists. Our results highlight that uncertainty in science is malleable and that visualization systems should be designed with this malleability in mind. Through a set of design implications, we advocate for visualizations that promote user agency and flexibility in defining and processing uncertainty.",Vanessa Peña Araya;Consuelo Martínez Fontaine;Xiang Wei;Guillaume Delpech;Anastasia Bezerianos,,,
CHI,2025,Understanding Marine Scientist Software Tool Use,10.1145/3706598.3713621,"Marine science researchers are heavy users of software tools and systems such as statistics packages, visualization tools, and online data catalogues. Following a constructivist grounded theory approach, we conduct a semi-structured interview study of 23 marine science researchers and research supports within a North American university, to understand their perceptions of and approaches towards using both graphical and code-based software tools and systems. We propose the concept of fragmentation to represent how various factors lead to isolated pockets of views and practices concerning software tool use during the research process. These factors include informal learning of tools, preferences towards doing things from scratch, and a push towards more code-based tools. Based on our findings, we suggest design priorities for user interfaces that could more effectively help support marine scientists make and use software tools and systems.",Matthew Lakier;Andrew Irwin;Daniel Vogel 0001,,,
CHI,2025,Blending the Worlds: An evaluation of World-Fixed Visual Appearances in Automotive Augmented Reality,10.1145/3706598.3713185,"With the transition to fully autonomous vehicles, non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) become increasingly important, allowing passengers to use their driving time more efficiently. In-car Augmented Reality (AR) gives the possibility to engage in NDRTs while also allowing passengers to engage with their surroundings, for example, by displaying world-fixed points of interest (POIs). This can lead to new discoveries, provide information about the environment, and improve locational awareness. To explore the optimal visualization of POIs using in-car AR, we conducted a field study (N = 38) examining six parameters: positioning, scaling, rotation, render distance, information density, and appearance. We also asked for intention of use, preferred seat positions and preferred automation level for the AR function in a post-study questionnaire. Our findings reveal user preferences and general acceptance of the AR functionality. Based on these results, we derived UX-guidelines for the visual appearance and behavior of location-based POIs in in-car AR.",Robin Connor Schramm;Markus Sasalovici;Jann Philipp Freiwald;Michael Martin Otto;Melissa Reinelt;Ulrich Schwanecke,,,
CHI,2025,PAIRcolator: Pair Collaboration for Sensemaking and Reflection on Personal Data,10.1145/3706598.3713332,"This paper explores pair collaboration as a novel approach for making sense of personal data. Pair collaboration—characterized by dyadic comparison and structured roles for questioning and reasoning—has proven effective for co-constructing knowledge. However, current collaborative visualization tools primarily focus on group comparisons, overlooking the challenges of accommodating pair collaboration in the context of personal data. To address this gap, we propose a set of design rationales supporting subjective data analysis through dyadic comparison and mixed-focus collaboration styles for co-constructing personal narratives. We operationalize these principles in a tangible visualization toolkit, PAIRcolator. Our user study demonstrates that pairwise collaboration facilitated by the toolkit: 1) reveals detailed data insights that are effective for recalling personal experiences, and 2) fosters a structured, reciprocal sensemaking process for interpreting and reconstructing personal experiences beyond data insights. Our results shed light on the design rationales for, and the processes of pair sensemaking of personal data, and their effects to foster deep levels of reflection.",Di Yan;Jacky Bourgeois;Yen-Chia Hsu;Gerd Kortuem,,,
CHI,2025,How Do People Perceive Bundling? An Experiment,10.1145/3706598.3713444,"We present an exploratory study on how people perceive visualizations of spatial social networks generated by edge bundling algorithms. Although these algorithms successfully minimize clutter in node-link diagrams, they do so through various methods that can sometimes create false connections between nodes. We conducted a qualitative experiment involving participants with technical expertise but no prior knowledge of edge bundling algorithms. Participants described their perceptions of both bundled and straight-line visualizations in open-ended tasks. Analysis of their annotations and transcripts revealed a general preference for bundled visualizations. However, when it came to false connections, participants tended to follow them in tightly bundled diagrams while also vocalizing that these drawings were more ambiguous. The routing of bundles influenced the perception of clusters and participants assigned more or fewer nodes to the clusters, depending on the routing of bundles. Participants' unfamiliarity with the dataset led them to use analogies to describe the bundled drawings, potentially adding perceived semantic meaning to the data.",Markus Wallinger;Osman Akbulut;Kabir Ahmed Rufai;Helen C.

CHI,2025,Lost in Magnitudes: Exploring Visualization Designs for Large Value Ranges,10.1145/3706598.3713487,"We explore the design of visualizations for values spanning multiple orders of magnitude; we call them Orders of Magnitude Values (OMVs). Visualization researchers have shown that separating OMVs into two components, the mantissa and the exponent, and encoding them separately overcomes limitations of linear and logarithmic scales. However, only a small number of such visualizations have been tested, and the design guidelines for visualizing the mantissa and exponent separately remain under-explored. To initiate this exploration, better understand the factors influencing the effectiveness of these visualizations, and create guidelines, we adopt a multi-stage workflow. We introduce a design space for visualizing mantissa and exponent, systematically generating and qualitatively evaluating all possible visualizations within it. From this evaluation, we derive guidelines. We select two visualizations that align with our guidelines and test them using a crowdsourcing experiment, showing they facilitate quantitative comparisons and increase confidence in interpretation compared to the state-of-the-art.",Katerina Batziakoudi;Florent Cabric;Stéphanie Rey;Jean-Daniel Fekete,,,
CHI,2025,The Gulf of Interpretation: From Chart to Message and Back Again,10.1145/3706598.3713413,"Charts are used to communicate data visually, but often, we do not know whether a chart's intended message aligns with the message readers perceive. In this mixed-methods study, we investigate how data journalists encode data and how members of a broad audience engage with, experience, and understand these visualizations. We conducted workshops and interviews with school and university students, job seekers, designers, and senior citizens to collect perceived messages and feedback on eight real-world charts. We analyzed these messages and compared them to the intended message. Our results help to understand the gulf that can exist between messages (that producers encode) and viewer interpretations. In particular, we find that consumers are often overwhelmed with the amount of data provided and are easily confused with terms that are not well known. Chart producers tend to follow strong conventions on how to visually encode particular information that might not always benefit consumers.",Christian Knoll 0004;Torsten Möller;Kathleen Gregory;Laura Koesten,,,
CHI,2025,Chartist: Task-driven Eye Movement Control for Chart Reading,10.1145/3706598.3713128,"To design data visualizations that are easy to comprehend, we need to understand how people with different interests read them. Computational models of predicting scanpaths on charts could complement empirical studies by offering estimates of user performance inexpensively; however, previous models have been limited to gaze patterns and overlooked the effects of tasks. Here, we contribute Chartist, a computational model that simulates how users move their eyes to extract information from the chart in order to perform analysis tasks, including value retrieval, filtering, and finding extremes. The novel contribution lies in a two-level hierarchical control architecture. At the high level, the model uses LLMs to comprehend the information gained so far and applies this representation to select a goal for the lower-level controllers, which, in turn, move the eyes in accordance with a sampling policy learned via reinforcement learning. The model is capable of predicting human-like task-driven scanpaths across various tasks. It can be applied in fields such as explainable AI, visualization design evaluation, and optimization. While it displays limitations in terms of generalizability and accuracy, it takes modeling in a promising direction, toward understanding human behaviors in interacting with charts.",Danqing Shi;Yao Wang 0018;Yunpeng Bai;Andreas Bulling;Antti Oulasvirta,,,
CHI,2025,Visualization Guardrails: Designing Interventions Against Cherry-Picking in Interactive Data Explorers,10.1145/3706598.3713385,"The growing popularity of interactive time series exploration platforms has made data visualization more accessible to the public. However, the ease of creating polished charts with preloaded data also enables selective information presentation, often resulting in biased or misleading visualizations. Research shows that these tools have been used to spread misinformation, particularly in areas such as public health and economic policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post hoc fact-checking may be ineffective because it typically addresses only a portion of misleading posts and comes too late to curb the spread. In this work, we explore using visualization design to counteract cherry-picking, a common tactic in deceptive visualizations. We propose a design space of guardrails—interventions to expose cherry-picking in time-series explorers. Through three crowd-sourced experiments, we demonstrate that guardrails, particularly those superimposing data, can encourage skepticism, though with some limitations. We provide recommendations for developing more effective visualization guardrails.",Maxim Lisnic;Zach Cutler;Marina Kogan;Alexander Lex,,,

Traditional cognitive-behavioral techniques for personal development rely on mental imagery to envision ideal selves, but may be less effective for individuals who struggle with visualization. This paper introduces Emotional Self-Voice (ESV), a novel system combining emotionally expressive language models and voice cloning technologies to render customized responses in the user's own voice. We investigate the potential of ESV to nudge individuals towards their ideal selves in a study with 60 participants. Across all three conditions (ESV, text-only, and mental imagination), we observed an increase in resilience, confidence, motivation, and goal commitment, and the ESV condition was perceived as uniquely engaging and personalized. We discuss the implications of designing generated self-voice systems as a personalized behavioral intervention for different scenarios.",Cathy Mengying Fang;Phoebe Chua;Samantha W. T.

In this paper, we partnered with communication researchers to develop visual analytics solutions for comparing NS and NNS behaviors in 162 writing sessions across 27 teams. The primary challenges in analyzing writing behaviors are data complexity and the uncertainties introduced by automated methods. In response, we present COALA, a novel visual analytics tool that improves model interpretability by displaying uncertainties in author clusters, generating behavior summaries using large language models, and visualizing writing-related actions at multiple granularities. We validated the effectiveness of COALA through user studies with domain experts (N=2+2) and researchers with relevant experience (N=8).

CHI,2025,"""Piecing Data Connections Together Like a Puzzle"": Effects of Increasing Task Complexity on the Effectiveness of Data Storytelling Enhanced Visualisations",10.1145/3706598.3714270,"The emerging concept of data storytelling (DS) suggests that enhancing visualisations with annotations and narratives can make complex data more insightful than conventional visualisations. Previous works found that DS-enhanced visualisations are more effective than conventional visualisations for simple tasks like identifying key data points or the main message. However, no previous work has explored the extent to which DS enhancements influence task completion across different levels of cognitive complexity. We address this gap by presenting the results of a study where 128 participants completed tasks based on four visualisations (two line charts and two choropleth maps, either with or without DS elements) spanning a range of complexity based on Bloom's taxonomy, which has been applied in data visualisation to categorise tasks hierarchically from lower to higher-order thinking. Results suggest that while DS-enhanced visualisations effectively support lower-order tasks (finding data points and understanding insights), they don't necessarily aid the correct completion of higher-order tasks (application, analysis, evaluation and creation).

We propose the concept of axis alignment to categorise input types and characterise the expanded scope of our system relative to existing tools. The declarative grammar consists of match conditions, which specify repeating patterns of input cells, and extract operations, which specify how matched values map to the output table. In the interactive interface, users can specify match and extract patterns by interacting with an input table, or author more advanced specifications in the coding panel. To refine and verify specifications, users interact with grammar-based provenance visualisations such as linked highlighting of input and output values, tree-based visualisation of matching patterns, and a mini-map overview of matched instances of patterns with annotations showing where cells are extracted to. We motivate and illustrate our work with real-world usage scenarios and workflows.",Kai Xiong;Cynthia A. Huang;Michael Wybrow;Yingcai Wu,,,

CHI,2025,"Data Formulator 2: Iterative Creation of Data Visualizations, with AI Transforming Data Along the Way",10.1145/3706598.3713296,"Data analysts often need to iterate between data transformations and chart designs to create rich visualizations for exploratory data analysis. Although many AI-powered systems have been introduced to reduce the effort of visualization authoring, existing systems are not well suited for iterative authoring. They typically require analysts to provide, in a single turn, a text-only prompt that fully describe a complex visualization. We introduce Data Formulator 2 (Df2 for short), an AI-powered visualization system designed to overcome this limitation. Df2 blends graphical user interfaces and natural language inputs to enable users to convey their intent more effectively, while delegating data transformation to AI. Furthermore, to support efficient iteration, Df2 lets users navigate their iteration history and reuse previous designs, eliminating the need to start from scratch each time. A user study with eight participants demonstrated that Df2 allowed participants to develop their own iteration styles to complete challenging data exploration sessions.",Chenglong Wang;Bongshin Lee;Steven Mark Drucker;Dan Marshall;Jianfeng Gao 0001,,,
CHI,2025,Reflecting on Design Paradigms of Animated Data Video Tools,10.1145/3706598.3713449,"Animated data videos have gained significant popularity in recent years. However, authoring data videos remains challenging due to the complexity of creating and coordinating diverse components (e.g., visualization, animation, audio, etc.). Although numerous tools have been developed to streamline the process, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding and reflection of their design paradigms to inform future development. To address this gap, we propose a framework for understanding data video creation tools along two dimensions: what data video components to create and coordinate, including visual, motion, narrative, and audio components, and how to support the creation and coordination. By applying the framework to analyze 46 existing tools, we summarized key design paradigms of creating and coordinating each component based on the varying work distribution for humans and AI in these tools.

However, visual analytics using DR often face unreliability, stemming from factors such as inherent distortions in DR projections. This unreliability can lead to analytic insights that misrepresent the underlying data, potentially resulting in misguided decisions. To tackle these reliability challenges, we review 133 papers that address the unreliability of visual analytics using DR. Through this review, we contribute (1) a workflow model that describes the interaction between analysts and machines in visual analytics using DR, and (2) a taxonomy that identifies where and why reliability issues arise within the workflow, along with existing solutions for addressing them. Our review reveals ongoing challenges in the field, whose significance and urgency are validated by five expert researchers.

ProtocolREing is critical task in malware and system security analysis. Several ProtocolREing automation tools have been developed, however, in practice, they are not used because they offer limited interaction. Instead, reverse engineers (ProtocolREs) perform this task manually or use less complex visualization tools. To give ProtocolREs the power of more complex automation, we must first understand ProtocolREs processes and information and interaction needs to design better interfaces. We interviewed 16 ProtocolREs, presenting a paper prototype ProtocolREing automation interface, and ask them to discuss their approach to ProtocolREing while using the tool and suggest missing information and interactions. We designed our prototype based on existing ProtocolREing tool features and prior reverse engineering research's usability guidelines.

To address this, we propose the concept of spatial physical computing and present SpatIO, an XR-based physical computing toolkit that supports a continuous end-to-end workflow. SpatIO consists of three interconnected subsystems: SpatIO Environment for composing and testing prototypes with virtual sensors and actuators, SpatIO Module for converting virtually placed components into physical ones, and SpatIO Code for authoring interactions with spatial visualization of data flow. Through a comparative user study with 20 designers, we found that SpatIO significantly altered workflow order, encouraged broader exploration of component placement, enhanced spatial correlation between code and components, and promoted in-situ bodily testing.",Seung Hyeon Han;Yeeun Han;Kyeongho Park;Sangjun Lee;Woohun Lee,,,
CHI,2025,Diagrammatization and Abduction to Improve AI Interpretability With Domain-Aligned Explanations for Medical Diagnosis,10.1145/3706598.3714058,"Many visualizations have been developed for explainable AI (XAI), but they often require further reasoning by users to interpret. Investigating XAI for high-stakes medical diagnosis, we propose improving domain alignment with diagrammatic and abductive reasoning to reduce the interpretability gap. We developed DiagramNet to predict cardiac diagnoses from heart auscultation, select the best-fitting hypothesis based on criteria evaluation, and explain with clinically-relevant murmur diagrams. The ante-hoc interpretable model leverages domain-relevant ontology, representation, and reasoning process to increase trust in expert users. In modeling studies, we found that DiagramNet not only provides faithful murmur shape explanations, but also has better performance than baseline models. We demonstrate the interpretability and trustworthiness of diagrammatic, abductive explanations in a qualitative user study with medical students, showing that clinically-relevant, diagrammatic explanations are preferred over technical saliency map explanations.

CHI,2025,Crowdsourced Think-Aloud Studies,10.1145/3706598.3714305,"The think-aloud (TA) protocol is a useful method for evaluating user interfaces, including data visualizations. However, TA studies are time-consuming to conduct and hence often have a small number of participants. Crowdsourcing TA studies would help alleviate these problems, but the technical overhead and the unknown quality of results have restricted TA to synchronous studies. To address this gap we introduce CrowdAloud, a system for creating and analyzing asynchronous, crowdsourced TA studies. CrowdAloud captures audio and provenance (log) data as participants interact with a stimulus. Participant audio is automatically transcribed and visualized together with events data and a full recreation of the state of the stimulus as seen by participants. To gauge the value of crowdsourced TA studies, we conducted two experiments: one to compare lab-based and crowdsourced TA studies, and one to compare crowdsourced TA studies with crowdsourced text prompts.

However, many tools only support creating basic ridgeline plots and overlook their diverse layouts and styles. This paper introduces a comprehensive design space for ridgeline plots, focusing on their varied layouts and expressive styles. We present RidgeBuilder, an intuitive tool for creating expressive ridgeline plots with customizable layouts and styles. In particular, we summarize three goals for refining the layout of ridgeline plots and propose an optimization method.

CHI,2025,Disentangling the Power Dynamics in Participatory Data Physicalisation,10.1145/3706598.3713703,"Participatory data physicalisation (PDP) is recognised for its potential to support data-driven decisions among stakeholders who collaboratively construct physical elements into commonly insightful visualisations. Like all participatory processes, PDP is however influenced by underlying power dynamics that might lead to issues regarding extractive participation, marginalisation, or exclusion, among others. We first identified the decisions behind these power dynamics by developing an ontology that synthesises critical theoretical insights from both visualisation and participatory design research, which were then systematically applied unto a representative corpus of 23 PDP artefacts. By revealing how shared decisions are guided by different agendas, this paper presents three contributions: 1) a cross-disciplinary ontology that facilitates the systematic analysis of existing and novel PDP artefacts and processes; which leads to 2) six PDP agendas that reflect the key power dynamics in current PDP practice, revealing the diversity of orientations towards stakeholder participation in PDP practice; and 3) a set of critical considerations that should guide how power dynamics can be balanced, such as by reflecting on how issues are represented, data is contextualised, participants express their meanings, and how participants can dissent with flexible artefact construction. Consequently, this study advances a feminist research agenda by guiding researchers and practitioners in openly reflecting on and sharing responsibilities in data physicalisation and participatory data visualisation.",Silvia Cazacu;Georgia Panagiotidou;Thérèse Steenberghen;Andrew Vande Moere,,,

To explore this area, we conducted semi-structured interviews about four real-world visualizations. We used thematic analysis to understand the types of information that participants used and diffractive reading to reveal how participants blended intra- and extratextual information. Our thematic analysis showed that participants utilized a broad assortment of information from both expected and unexpected sources. Additionally, our diffractive reading exposed three ways that participants incorporated intra- and extratextual information: to decide what to look at, to make (in)accurate assumptions about what the visualization showed, and to discover insights beyond what was directly encoded.",Alyxander Burns;Claudia Gonzalez-Vazquez,,,

In this space, we then concretely explore two control mappings: spread-to-generate and pinch-to-shorten, with visual feedback loops. We evaluate this concept in a user study (N=14) that compares three feedback designs: no visualisation, text length indicator, and length + word indicator. The results demonstrate that touch-based control of LLMs is both feasible and user-friendly, with the length + word indicator proving most effective for managing text generation.

We operationalize these principles into a personal visualization toolkit, which we evaluate with an observational study involving 16 university students (8 pairs) analyzing each other's screen-time data. Our findings reveal that implementing the proposed design principles: (1) facilitated data comparison from shared subjective perspectives, (2) helped coordinate sensemaking while allowing time for understanding personal data, and (3) helped the contextualization of data patterns, in turn aiding self-reflection.",Di Yan;Chenge Tang;Senthil Chandrasegaran;Gerd Kortuem,,,
CHI,2025,GenPara: Enhancing the 3D Design Editing Process by Inferring Users' Regions of Interest with Text-Conditional Shape Parameters,10.1145/3706598.3713502,"In 3D design, specifying design objectives and visualizing complex shapes through text alone proves to be a significant challenge. Although advancements in 3D GenAI have significantly enhanced part assembly and the creation of high-quality 3D designs, many systems still to dynamically generate and edit design elements based on the shape parameters. To bridge this gap, we propose GenPara, an interactive 3D design editing system that leverages text-conditional shape parameters of part-aware 3D designs and visualizes design space within the Exploration Map and Design Versioning Tree. Additionally, among the various shape parameters generated by LLM, the system extracts and provides design outcomes within the user's regions of interest based on Bayesian inference. A user study (N = 16) revealed that GenPara enhanced the comprehension and management of designers with text-conditional shape parameters, streamlining design exploration and concretization. This improvement boosted efficiency and creativity of the 3D design process.",Jiin Choi 0001;Seung Won Lee;Kyung Hoon Hyun,,,
CHI,2025,"""Housing Diversity Means Diverse Housing"": Blending Generative AI into Speculative Design in Rural Co-Housing Communities",10.1145/3706598.3713906,"In response to various environmental and societal challenges, co-housing has emerged to support social cohesion, grassroots innovation and ecological regeneration. Co-housing communities typically have smaller personal spaces, closer neighbourly relationships, and engage in more mutually supportive sustainable practices. To understand such communities' motivations and visions, we developed a speculative design tool that harnesses Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the envisioning of alternative future scenarios that challenge prevailing values, beliefs, lifestyles, and ways of knowing in contemporary society. Within the context of co-housing communities, we conducted a participatory design study with participants in co-creating their future communities. This paper unpacks implications and also reflects on the co-design approach employing GenAI. Our main findings highlight that GenAI, as a catalyst for imagination, empowers individuals to create visualisations that pose questions through a plural and situated speculative discourse.",Hongyi Tao;Dhaval Vyas,,,
CHI,2025,Ad-Blocked Reality: Evaluating User Perceptions of Content Blocking Concepts Using Extended Reality,10.1145/3706598.3713230,"Inspired by the concepts of diminishing reality and ad-blocking in browsers, this study investigates the perceived benefits and concerns of blocking physical, real-world content, particularly ads, through Extended Reality (XR). To understand how users perceive this concept, we first conducted a user study (N = 18) with an ad-blocking prototype to gather initial insights. The results revealed a mixed willingness to adopt XR blockers, with participants appreciating aspects such as customizability, convenience, and privacy. Expected benefits included enhanced focus and reduced stress, while concerns centered on missing important information and increased feelings of isolation. Hence, we investigated the user acceptance of different ad-blocking visualizations through a follow-up online survey (N = 120), comparing six concepts based on related work. The results indicated that the XR ad-blocker visualizations play a significant role in how and for what kinds of advertisements such a concept might be used, paving the path for future feedback-driven prototyping.",Christopher Katins;Jannis Strecker;Jan Hinrichs;Pascal Knierim;Bastian Pfleging;Thomas Kosch,,,
CHI,2025,A Placebo Concert: The Placebo Effect for Visualization of Physiological Audience Data during Experience Recreation in Virtual Reality,10.1145/3706598.3713594,"A core use case for Virtual Reality applications is recreating real-life scenarios for training or entertainment. Promoting physiological responses for users in VR that match those of real-life spectators can maximize engagement and contribute to more co-presence. Current research focuses on visualizations and measurements of physiological data to ensure experience accuracy. However, placebo effects are known to influence performance and self-perception in HCI studies, creating a need to investigate the effect of visualizing different types of data (real, unmatched, and fake) on user perception during event recreation in VR. We investigate these conditions through a balanced between-groups study (n=44) of uninformed and informed participants. The informed group was provided with the information that the data visualizations represented previously recorded human physiological data. Our findings reveal a placebo effect, where the informed group demonstrated enhanced engagement and co-presence.

However, current interaction paradigms often struggle to effectively facilitate multi-round idea exploration and selection, leading to random outputs, unclear iterations, and cognitive overload. To address these challenges, we propose a human-AI co-ideation framework aimed at tracking the evolution of design ideas. This framework leverages a structured idea representation, an analogy-based reasoning mechanism and interactive visualization techniques. It guides both designers and AI to systematically explore design spaces. We also develop a prototype system, IdeationWeb, which integrates an intuitive, mind map-like visual interface and interactive methods to support co-ideation.

CHI,2025,Plume: Scaffolding Text Composition in Dashboards,10.1145/3706598.3713580,"Text in dashboards plays multiple critical roles, including providing context, offering insights, guiding interactions, and summarizing key information. Despite its importance, most dashboarding tools focus on visualizations and offer limited support for text authoring. To address this gap, we developed Plume, a system to help authors craft effective dashboard text. Through a formative review of exemplar dashboards, we created a typology of text parameters and articulated the relationship between visual placement and semantic connections, which informed Plume's design. Plume employs large language models (LLMs) to generate contextually appropriate content and provides guidelines for writing clear, readable text. A preliminary evaluation with 12 dashboard authors explored how assisted text authoring integrates into workflows, revealing strengths and limitations of LLM-generated text and the value of our human-in-the-loop approach.

CHI,2025,ARticulate: Interactive Visual Guidance for Demonstrated Rotational Degrees of Freedom in Mobile AR,10.1145/3706598.3713179,"Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) offers a powerful way to provide spatially-aware guidance for real-world applications. In many cases, these applications involve the configuration of a camera or articulated subject, asking users to navigate several spatial degrees of freedom (DOF) at once. Most guidance for such tasks relies on decomposing available DOF into subspaces that can be more easily mapped to simple 1D or 2D visualizations. Unfortunately, different factorizations of the same motion often map to very different visual feedback, and finding the factorization that best matches a user's intuition can be difficult. We propose an interactive approach that infers rotational degrees of freedom from short user demonstrations. Users select one or two DOFs at a time by demonstrating a small range of motion, which we use to learn a rotational frame that best aligns with user control of the object. We show that deriving visual feedback from this inferred learned rotational frame leads to improved task completion times on 6DOF guidance tasks compared to standard default reference frames used in most mixed reality applications.",Nhan (Nathan) Tran;Ethan Yang;Abe Davis,,,

However, what constitutes a decision problem, and what is required for an experiment to conclude that decisions are flawed, remain imprecise. We present a widely applicable definition of a decision problem synthesized from statistical decision theory and information economics. We claim that to attribute loss in human performance to bias, an experiment must provide the information that a rational agent would need to identify the normative decision. We evaluate whether recent empirical research on AI-assisted decisions achieves this standard. We find that only 10 (26%) of 39 studies that claim to identify biased behavior presented participants with sufficient information to make this claim in at least one treatment condition. We motivate the value of studying well-defined decision problems by describing a characterization of performance losses they allow to be conceived.",Jessica Hullman;Alex Kale;Jason D. Hartline,,,

Then, an AI-powered framework called AIFiligree is developed by optimizing culture-based labels and training parameters, enabling the generation of highly authentic fine filigree structures. Further, user workflows are introduced to support diverse design scenarios. Through user studies involving 22 filigree experts and 16 designers, we finally gained insights into AI's opportunities and challenges in cultural learning, expression, and design.",Ye Tao 0001;Xiaohui Fu;Jiaying Wu;Ze Bian;Aiyu Zhu;Qi Bao;Weiyue Zheng;Yubo Wang 0009;Bin Zhu 0013;Cheng Yang 0014;Chuyi Zhou,,,
CHI,2025,"The Anatomy of a Plea: How Uncertainty, Visualizations & Individual Differences Shape Plea Bargain Decisions",10.1145/3706598.3713096,"Plea bargains are commonly used in the criminal justice system, where they can offer potential benefits to both the prosecution and the defendant. However, research has shown that defendants often engage in poor decision-making, such as accepting the plea even when the trial sentence is likely to be less severe. While previous studies have shown some evidence that uncertainty visualizations can improve decision-making, there is a lack of research on their effectiveness in domain-specific tasks like plea bargain decision-making. In this work, we conduct a series of experiments to explore whether the presence and format of uncertainty impact plea bargain decisions, taking into account time pressure and individual differences. Our findings reveal that these factors can have a significant impact on plea bargain decisions. We also show evidence that communicating uncertainty in the form of text can elicit more optimal decisions under time-pressure conditions.",Melanie Bancilhon;Alvitta Ottley;Andrew Jordan,,,
CHI,2025,Augmented Journeys: Interactive Points of Interest for In-Car Augmented Reality,10.1145/3706598.3714323,"As passengers spend more time in vehicles, the demand for non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) increases. In-car Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to enhance passenger experiences by enabling interaction with the environment through NDRTs using world-fixed Points of Interest (POIs). However, the effectiveness of existing interaction techniques and visualization methods for in-car AR remains unclear. Based on a survey (N=110) and a pre-study (N=10), we developed an interactive in-car AR system using a video see-through head-mounted display to engage with POIs via eye-gaze and pinch. Users could explore passed and upcoming POIs using three visualization techniques: List, Timeline, and Minimap. We evaluated the system's feasibility in a field study (N=21). Our findings indicate general acceptance of the system, with the List visualization being the preferred method for exploring POIs. Additionally, the study highlights limitations of current AR hardware, particularly the impact of vehicle movement on 3D interaction.",Robin Connor Schramm;Ginevra Fedrizzi;Markus Sasalovici;Jann Philipp Freiwald;Ulrich Schwanecke,,,
CHI,2025,SocialEyes: Scaling Mobile Eye-tracking to Multi-person Social Settings,10.1145/3706598.3713910,"Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Challenges in real-world, multi-person environments have, however, restrained eye-tracking research predominantly to single-person, in-lab settings. We developed a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data from multiple mobile eye-tracking devices during collective viewing experiences (e.g., concerts, films, lectures). We implemented lightweight operator interfaces for real-time-monitoring, remote-troubleshooting, and gaze-projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. We tested the system in a live concert and a film screening with 30 simultaneous viewers during each of two public events (N=60). We observe precise time-synchronisation between devices measured through recorded clock-offsets, and accurate gaze-projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Our novel analysis metrics and visualizations illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data for understanding collaborative behaviour and social interaction. This advancement promotes ecological validity in eye-tracking research and paves the way for innovative interactive tools.",Shreshth Saxena;Areez Visram;Neil Lobo;Zahid Mirza;Mehak Rafi Khan;Biranugan Pirabaharan;Alexander Nguyen;Lauren K.

CHI,2025,Divisi: Interactive Search and Visualization for Scalable Exploratory Subgroup Analysis,10.1145/3706598.3713103,"Analyzing data subgroups is a common data science task to build intuition about a dataset and identify areas to improve model performance. However, subgroup analysis is prohibitively difficult in datasets with many features, and existing tools limit unexpected discoveries by relying on user-defined or static subgroups. We propose exploratory subgroup analysis as a set of tasks in which practitioners discover, evaluate, and curate interesting subgroups to build understanding about datasets and models. To support these tasks we introduce Divisi, an interactive notebook-based tool underpinned by a fast approximate subgroup discovery algorithm. Divisi's interface allows data scientists to interactively re-rank and refine subgroups and to visualize their overlap and coverage in the novel Subgroup Map. Through a think-aloud study with 13 practitioners, we find that Divisi can help uncover surprising patterns in data features and their interactions, and that it encourages more thorough exploration of subtypes in complex data.",Venkatesh Sivaraman;Zexuan Li;Adam Perer,,,
CHI,2025,"Progression Balancing × Baldur's Gate 3: Insights, Terms and Tools for Multi-Dimensional Video Game Balance",10.1145/3706598.3713162,"Internal game balancing is one of the major components that affect player experience, as it is responsible for a large share of development time, the majority of game update patches and long-term player satisfaction. This makes tools and methodologies of assessing and advancing game balance a valuable endeavor for industry and academia. During the past decades, scientific research produced numerous outputs to inform and enhance game balancing, yet most of them only adhere to a single dimension of balance: fixed (end-game) scenarios. However, games are usually experienced throughout a continuous spectrum of ever-changing constellations, which should be reflected. Using simulation, game-playing AI, visual analytics and informative metrics, we introduce a methodology and implementation of Progression Balancing, incorporating multi-dimensional game aspects. For the sake of exposition and ecological validity, we applied it in one of the most successful recent games (Baldur's Gate 3), and evaluated its efficacy with help of its player community.",Johannes Pfau,,,
CHI,2025,Confirmation Bias: The Double-Edged Sword of Data Facts in Visual Data Communication,10.1145/3706598.3713831,"Incorporating data facts, which are natural language descriptions of data patterns, alongside visualizations can guide readers and enhance the visibility of data patterns. However, data facts might also induce confirmation bias in visual analysis. We conducted a series of crowdsourced experiments to explore the biasing effects of data facts. Our findings show that the presentation style, strength, and alignment of data facts with pre-existing beliefs significantly impact confirmation bias. Data facts that support prior beliefs can exacerbate confirmation bias, whereas those that refute an individual's beliefs can mitigate it. This effect is amplified when data facts are used in combination with visual annotations. Data facts describing variable correlations are perceived to be more compelling than ones describing average values and are associated with higher levels of confirmation bias. We underscore the persuasive influence of data facts in visualizations and caution against their indiscriminate use in efforts to mitigate bias.",Shiyao Li;Thomas James Davidson;Cindy Xiong Bearfield;Emily Wall 0001,,,
CHI,2025,The Many Tendrils of the Octopus Map,10.1145/3706598.3713583,"Conspiratorial thinking can connect many distinct or distant ills to a central cause. This belief has visual form in the octopus map: a map where a central force (for instance a nation, an ideology, or an ethnicity) is depicted as a literal or figurative octopus, with extending tendrils. In this paper, we explore how octopus maps function as visual arguments through an analysis of historical examples as well as a through a crowd-sourced study on how the underlying data and the use of visual metaphors contribute to specific negative or conspiratorial interpretations. We find that many features of the data or visual style can lead to ""octopus-like"" thinking in visualizations, even without the use of an explicit octopus motif. We conclude with a call for a deeper analysis of visual rhetoric, and an acknowledgment of the potential for the design of data visualizations to contribute to harmful or conspiratorial thinking.",Eduardo Puerta;Shani Claire Spivak;Michael Correll,,,
CHI,2025,PiaMuscle: Improving Piano Skill Acquisition by Cost-effectively Estimating and Visualizing Activities of Miniature Hand Muscles,10.1145/3706598.3713465,"Understanding neuromusculoskeletal mechanisms significantly impacts skill specialization and proficiency. While existing methods can infer large muscle activities during gross motor movements, the estimation of dexterous motor control involving miniature muscles remains underexplored. Targeting the coordinated hand muscles in advanced piano performance, we learn spatiotemporal discrete representations of electromyography (EMG) data and hand postures utilizing a multimodal dataset. Subsequently, we train a precise and cost-effective neural network model. Based on this model, PiaMuscle is introduced to investigate if visualizing muscle activities during piano training enhances piano performance. Quantitative and qualitative results of a user study with highly skilled professional pianists demonstrate that PiaMuscle provides reliable muscle activation data to support and optimize force control. Our research underscores the potential of a naturalistic workflow to estimate small muscles' activities from readily accessible human-centric information and more accurately when combined with tool-centric data, thereby enhancing skill acquisition.",Ruofan Liu 0001;Yichen Peng;Takanori Oku;Chen-Chieh Liao;Erwin Wu;Shinichi Furuya;Hideki Koike,,,

While a few studies made recommendations on how to choose colors and opacity levels to maintain depth perception, they often conflict and overlook the interaction effect between these factors. In this paper, we systematically explore the impact of color and opacity on depth order perception across eight colors, three opacity levels, and various layer orders and arrangements. Our inferential analysis shows that both color hue and opacity significantly influence depth order perception, with the effectiveness depending on their interaction. We also derived 12 features for predictive analysis, achieving the best mean accuracy of 80.72% and mean F1 score of 87.75%, with opacity assigned to the front layer as the top feature for most models. Finally, we provide a small design tool and four guidelines to better align the design rules of colors and opacity in semi-transparent visualizations.",Zhiyuan Meng;Yunpeng Yang;Qiong Zeng;Kecheng Lu;Lin Lu 0001;Changhe Tu;Fumeng Yang;Yunhai Wang,,,
CHI,2025,Exploring Design Spaces to Facilitate Household Collaboration for Cohabiting Couples,10.1145/3706598.3713383,"Household collaboration among cohabiting couples presents unique challenges due to the intimate nature of the relationships and the lack of external rewards. Current efficiency-oriented technologies neglect these distinct dynamics. Our study aims to examine the real-world context and underlying needs of couples in their collaborative homemaking. We conducted a 10-day empirical investigation involving six Korean couples, supplemented by a probe approach to facilitate reflection on their current homemaking practices. We identified the requirement for ideal household collaboration as a 'shared ritual for celebratory interaction' and pinpointed the challenges in achieving this goal. We propose three design opportunities for domestic technology to address this gap: strengthening the meaning of housework around family values, supporting recognition of the partner's efforts through visualization, and initiating negotiation through defamiliarization. These insights extend the design considerations for domestic technologies, advocating for a broader understanding of the values contributing to satisfactory homemaking activities within the household.",Gahyeon Bae;Seo Kyoung Park;Taewan Kim;Hwajung Hong,,,
CHI,2025,Effects of Alternative Scatterplot Designs on Belief,10.1145/3706598.3713809,"Viewers tend to underestimate correlation in positively correlated scatterplots. However, systematically changing the size and opacity of scatterplot points can bias estimates upwards, correcting for this underestimation. Here, we examine whether the application of these visualisation techniques goes beyond a simple perceptual effect and could actually influence beliefs about information from trusted news sources. We present a fully-reproducible study in which we demonstrate that scatterplot manipulations that are able to correct for the correlation underestimation bias can also induce stronger levels of belief change compared to conventional scatterplots presenting identical data. Consequently, we show that novel visualisation techniques can be used to drive belief change, and suggest future directions for extending this work with regards to altering attitudes and behaviours.",Gabriel Strain;Andrew J.

Designing visually compelling casts of characters requires significant skill and consideration, and there is a lack of specialized tools to support this endeavor. We investigate how AI-driven image-generation techniques can empower creatives to explore a variety of visual design possibilities for individual and groups of characters. Informed by interviews with character designers, Paratrouper is a multi-modal system that enables creating and experimenting with multiple permutations for character casts and visualizing them in various contexts as part of a holistic approach to design. We demonstrate how Paratrouper supports different aspects of the character design process, and share insights from its use by eight creators.

CHI,2025,A Novel Lens on Metacognition in Visualization,10.1145/3706598.3714400,"Metacognition, or the awareness and regulation of one's own cognitive processes, allows individuals to take command of their learning and decision making in various contexts. In tasks that require problem-solving and adaptive learning, individuals with heightened metacognitive awareness tend to outperform others, as they are better equipped to regulate cognition, leading to more effective processes. On the other hand, visualization research facilitates exploration and decision making with data. We posit that metacognitive frameworks that examine how individuals think about their own thinking processes can likewise enhance visualization processes. In this paper, we review metacognition literature from the cognitive and learning science to identify opportunities in visualization to improve people's ability to reason with data. We propose the use of a metacognitive framework, serving as a starting point to inspire future research to improve visualization practices and outcomes.",Mengyu Chen;Andrew Yang;Seungchan Min;Kristy A.

CHI,2025,RemapVR: An Immersive Authoring Tool for Rapid Prototyping of Remapped Interaction in VR,10.1145/3706598.3714201,"Remapping techniques in VR such as repositioning, redirection, and resizing have been extensively studied. Still, interaction designers rarely have the opportunity to use them due to high technical and knowledge barriers. In the paper, we extract common features of 24 existing remapping techniques and develop a high-fidelity immersive authoring tool, namely RemapVR, for rapidly building and experiencing prototypes of remapped space properties in VR that are unperceivable or acceptable to users. RemapVR provides designers with a series of functions for editing remappings and visualizing spatial property changes, mapping relationships between real and virtual worlds, sensory conflicts, etc. Designers can quickly build existing remappings via templates, and author new remappings by interactively recording spatial relations between input trajectory in real world and output trajectory in virtual world. User studies showed that the designs of RemapVR can effectively improve designers' authoring experience and efficiency, and support designers to author remapping prototypes that meet scene requirements and provide good user experience.",Tianren Luo;Tong Wu;Chaoyong Jiang;Xinran Duan;Jiafu Lv;Nianlong Li;Yachun Fan;Teng Han;Feng Tian 0001,,,

While previous context-aware adaptations focused on usability and ergonomics, we explore the design space of privacy-driven adaptations that allow users to meet their dynamic needs. These techniques offer granular control over AR sensing capabilities across various AR input, output, and interaction modalities, aiming to minimize degradations to the user experience. Through an elicitation study with 10 AR researchers, we derive 62 privacy-focused adaptation techniques that preserve key AR functionalities and classify them into system-driven, user-driven, and mixed-initiative approaches to create an adaptation catalog. We also contribute a visualization tool that helps AR developers navigate the design space, validating its effectiveness in design workshops with six AR developers.

As users navigate across the dual realities—desktop and AR—a way to move 3D objects between them is needed. We devise three baseline transition techniques based on common approaches in the literature and evaluate their usability and practicality in an initial user study (N=18). After refining both our transition techniques and the surrounding technical setup, we validate the applicability of the overall concept for real-world activities in an expert user study (N=6). In it, computational chemists followed their usual desktop workflows to build, manipulate, and analyze 3D molecular structures, but now aided with the addition of AR and our transition techniques.

CHI,2025,Seeing Eye to AI? Applying Deep-Feature-Based Similarity Metrics to Information Visualization,10.1145/3706598.3713955,"Judging the similarity of visualizations is crucial to various applications, such as visualization-based search and visualization recommendation systems. Recent studies show deep-feature-based similarity metrics correlate well with perceptual judgments of image similarity and serve as effective loss functions for tasks like image super-resolution and style transfer. We explore the application of such metrics to judgments of visualization similarity. We extend a similarity metric using five ML architectures and three pre-trained weight sets. We replicate results from previous crowdsourced studies on scatterplot and visual channel similarity perception. Notably, our metric using pre-trained ImageNet weights outperformed gradient-descent tuned MS-SSIM, a multi-scale similarity metric based on luminance, contrast, and structure. Our work contributes to understanding how deep-feature-based metrics can enhance similarity assessments in visualization, potentially improving visual analysis tools and techniques.

CHI,2025,Trustworthy by Design: The Viewer's Perspective on Trust in Data Visualization,10.1145/3706598.3713824,"Despite the importance of viewers' trust in data visualization, there is a lack of research on the viewers' own perspective on their trust. In addition, much of the research on trust remains relatively theoretical and inaccessible for designers. This work aims to address this gap by conducting a qualitative study to explore how viewers perceive different data visualizations and how their perceptions impact their trust. Three dominant themes emerged from the data. First, users appeared to be consistent, listing similar rationale for their trust across different stimuli. Second, there were diverse opinions about what factors were most important to trust perception and about why the factors matter. Third, despite this disagreement, there were important trends to the factors that users reported as impactful. Finally, we leverage these themes to give specific and actionable guidelines for visualization designers to make more trustworthy visualizations.",Oen G. McKinley;Saugat Pandey;Alvitta Ottley,,,

However, little is known about how people actually touch physicalizations. We recorded verbal and tactile responses to data physicalizations in three consecutive conditions: as an unspecified object, as a representation of unknown data, and with full information about data and encoding. Our two stimulus objects present data for nine countries in a 3x3 grid. We varied vertical axis polarity, with positive data values either above (convex) or below (concave) baseline. Using an analog tracer method, we examine whether some components of the physicalization are touched more than others, whether touch varies by task and the impact of axis polarity. We found large differences in the degree to which different components were touched and that the effect of vertical axis polarity depended on task. We describe additional tactile and verbal behaviors that can inform the design of data physicalizations.",Dietmar Offenhuber;Laura J. Perovich;Bernice E. Rogowitz,,,
CHI,2025,GistVis: Automatic Generation of Word-scale Visualizations from Data-rich Documents,10.1145/3706598.3713881,"Data-rich documents are ubiquitous in various applications, yet they often rely solely on textual descriptions to convey data insights. Prior research primarily focused on providing visualization-centric augmentation to data-rich documents. However, few have explored using automatically generated word-scale visualizations to enhance the document-centric reading process. As an exploratory step, we propose GistVis, an automatic pipeline that extracts and visualizes data insight from text descriptions. GistVis decomposes the generation process into four modules: Discoverer, Annotator, Extractor, and Visualizer, with the first three modules utilizing the capabilities of large language models and the fourth using visualization design knowledge. Technical evaluation including a comparative study on Discoverer and an ablation study on Annotator reveals decent performance of GistVis. Meanwhile, the user study (N=12) showed that GistVis could generate satisfactory word-scale visualizations, indicating its effectiveness in facilitating users' understanding of data-rich documents (+5.6% accuracy) while significantly reducing their mental demand (p=0.016) and perceived effort (p=0.033).",Ruishi Zou;Yinqi Tang;Jingzhu Chen;Siyu Lu;Yan Lu;Yingfan Yang;Chen Ye 0002,,,

To bridge this gap, we conduct a two-part user study with 22 business professionals across marketing, sales, product, and operations roles. The first study examines their existing WIA practices, tools, and challenges. Findings reveal that business professionals perform many WIA techniques independently using rudimentary tools due to various constraints. We then implement representative WIA techniques in a visual analytics prototype and use it as a probe to conduct a follow-up study evaluating business professionals' practical use of the techniques. Results show that these techniques improve decision-making efficiency and confidence while underscoring the need for better support in data preparation, risk assessment, and domain knowledge integration.
