Given an input csv file, this will update the resource files.

The CSV file ahould have the following columns:
- DOI: the DOI of the paper
- name: the name of the resource
- url: the URL of the resource
- icon: the icon of the resource

For each row, the DOI will be used to find the corresponding paper in the intermediate file.
The resource will be added to the paper's resource list as long as the url is not already in the list.
